<h2><a name="THE_PROLOGUE" id="THE_PROLOGUE"></a>THE PROLOGUE.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">IN THE GLADE AND BY THE MOONLIGHT.</span></h2>


<p>The great, round moon looked down in a flood of silver
light upon the virgin forest by the banks of the Scioto,
the beautiful river which winds through the richest and
fairest valley in all the wide western land—the great
corn valley of the Shawnee tribe—those red warriors
who, in their excursions across the Ohio (the “La Belle”
river of the early French adventurers) had given to the
plains and valleys of Kentucky the name of “The Dark
and Bloody Land.”</p>

<p>The tree-tops were green and silver; but under the
spreading branches, sable was the gloom.</p>

<p>The strange, odd noises of the night broke the forest
stillness. One hears all noises in the night even in a civilized
land; how much more wondrous then are the wild,
free cries of the inhabitants of the great greenwood, untrammeled
by the restraining hand of man!</p>

<p>The free winds surged with a mournful sound through
the branches of the wood.</p>

<p>A ring around the moon told the coming storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Dark masses of clouds dashed across the sky, ever and anon
vailing in the “mistress of the night,” as though some unquiet
spirit was envious of the pale moonbeams, and wished to
cover, with its mantle, the earth, and cloak an evil deed.</p>

<p>A frightened deer came dashing through the aisles of the
forest—a noble buck with branching horns that told of many
a year spent under the greenwood tree.</p>

<p>Across a little open glade, whereon the moonbeams fell—kissing
the earth as though they loved it—dashed the deer,
and then, entering again the dark recesses of the forest, the
brown coat of the wood-prince was lost in the inky gloom.</p>

<p>Then in the trail of the buck, guided by the noise of the
rustling branches, came a dark form.</p>

<p>As the form stole, with noiseless tread, across the moonlit
glade, it displayed the person of an Indian warrior.</p>

<p>A red brave, decked out in deer-skin garb, stained with the
pigments of the earth in many colors, and fringed in fanciful
fashion.</p>

<p>The warrior was a tall and muscular savage, one of Nature’s
noblemen. A son of the wilderness untrammeled by the taint
of civilization—a brave of the great Shawnee tribe, the lords
of the Ohio valley from the oil “licks” of the Alleghany
stream to the level prairies where the Wabash and the White
pour their muddy tide into the great river of the New World,
the winding, smiling Ohio.</p>

<p>Fast on the trail of the deer he followed, although the chase
was almost hopeless.</p>

<p>Hardly had the warrior crossed the glade and entered the
thicket, when, on his track—following him as he was following
the deer—came another form through the forest.</p>

<p>A form that moved with noiseless steps; a form that cast
behind it a shadow gigantic in its hight.</p>

<p>The form did not pass across the glade, but skulked around
it in the shadow, as though it feared the moonlight.</p>

<p>The warrior penetrated into the thicket beyond the glade,
but a hundred yards or so. Then satisfied that the deer was
thoroughly alarmed and had sought safety in flight, the warrior
began to retrace his steps. The Shawnee brave dreamed
not of the dark and fearful form—that seemed neither man
nor beast—that lurked in his track.</p>

<p>He had hunted the deer, but little thought that he, too, in
turn was hunted.</p>

<p>The red chief guessed not that the dread demon of his nation—the
terrible foe who had left his red “totem” on the
breast of many a stout Shawnee brave—was even now on
his track, eager for that blood which was necessary to its
existence.</p>

<p>With careless steps the warrior retraced his way.</p>

<p>From behind a tree-trunk came the terrible form. One
single blow, and a tomahawk crashed through the brain of
the red-man.</p>

<p>With a groan the Shawnee chief sunk lifeless to the earth.</p>

<p>The dark form bent over him for a moment. Three rapid
knife-slashes, and the mark of the destroyer was blazoned on
the breast of the victim, reddened with blood.</p>

<p>Then through the aisles of the forest stole the dark form.</p>

<p>All living things—the insects of the earth—the birds of the
night—shrunk from its path.</p>

<p>It crossed the glade full in the soft light of the moon.</p>

<p>The rays of the orb of night fell upon a huge gray wolf,
who walked erect like a man! The face of the wolf was that
of a human. In the paw of the beast glistened the tomahawk
of the red-man, the edge now scarlet with the blood of the
Shawnee chief.</p>

<p>For a moment the moon looked upon the huge and terrible
figure, and then, as if struck with deadly fear at the awful
sight, hid itself behind a dark cloud.</p>

<p>When it again came forth, the strange and terrible being,
that wore the figure of a wolf and the face of a man, had
disappeared, swallowed up in the gloom of the forest.</p>

<p>Once again the creatures of the night came forth. Again
the shrill cries broke the stillness of the wood.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE MARK ON THE TREE.</span></h2>


<p>Two rifle-“cracks” broke the stillness of the wilderness,
that stretched in one almost unbroken line from the Alleghany
and Blue Ridge peaks to the Ohio river. The reports
re-echoed over the broad expanse of the Kanawha and Ohio
rivers, for the shots were fired near the junction of the two
streams—fired so nearly at the same time that the two seemed
almost like one report.</p>

<p>Then, before the smoke of the rifles had curled lazily upward
in spiral rings on the air, came a crash in the tangled
underbrush, and forth into a little open glade—the work of
Nature’s master hand—dashed a noble buck. The red stream
bursting from a wound just behind the shoulder and staining
crimson the glossy brown coat of the forest lord, told plainly
that he was stricken unto death.</p>

<p>The buck gained the center of the glade, then his stride
weakened; the dash through the thicket was the last despairing
effort of the poor brute to escape from the invisible foes
whose death-dealing balls had pierced his side.</p>

<p>With a moan of pain, almost human in its expression, the
buck fell upon his knees, then rolled over on his side, dead.</p>

<p>The brute had fallen near the trunk of a large oak tree—a
tree distinguished from its neighbors by a blazon upon its
side, whereon, in rude characters, some solitary hunter had
cut his name.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the death-bleat of the buck pierced the silence
of the glen, when two men came dashing through the woods,
each eager to be the first to secure the game.</p>

<p>One of the two was some twenty yards in advance of the
other, and reached the body of the dead buck just as his rival
emerged from the thicket.</p>

<p>Placing his foot upon the buck, and rifle in hand, he prepared
to dispute the quarry with the second hunter, for both
men—strangers to each other—had fired at the same deer.</p>

<p>The hunter who stood with his foot upon the buck, in an
attitude of proud defiance, had reloaded his rifle as he ran
and was prepared to defend his right to the game to the bitter
end.</p>

<p>In person, the hunter was a muscular, well-built man,
standing some six feet in hight. Not a clumsy, overgrown
giant, hardly able to bear his own weight, but a man as supple
and as active as a panther. He was clad in buck-skin
hunting-shirt and leggins, made in the Indian fashion, but
unlike that fashion in one respect, and that was that no
gaudy ornaments decorated the garments. Upon the feet of
the hunter were a pair of moccasins. A cap rudely fashioned
from a piece of deer-skin, and with the little flat tail of the
animal as an ornament, completed the dress of the hunter.</p>

<p>The face of the man was singular to look upon. The features
were large and clearly cut. The cold gray eye, broad
forehead, and massive, squarely-chiseled chin, told of dauntless
courage and of an iron will. A terrible scar extended
from the temple to the chin on the left side of the face.</p>

<p>The hunter was quite young—not over twenty-five, though
deep lines of care were upon the face.</p>

<p>The second hunter, who came from the tangled thicket,
but paused on the edge of the little glen on beholding the
threatening attitude of the hunter who stood with his foot on
the deer, was a man who had probably seen forty years.
He, too, like the other, was of powerful build, and his muscular
frame gave promise of great strength.</p>

<p>He was dressed, like the first, in the forest garb of deer-skin,
but his dress was gayly fringed and ornamented.</p>

<p>In his hand he bore one of the long rifles so common to the
frontier settler of that time, for our story is of the year 1780.</p>

<p>The clear blue eye of the second hunter took in the situation
at a glance. He readily saw that the man who stood so
defiantly by the deer was not disposed to yield his claim to
the animal without a struggle. So the second hunter determined
upon a parley.</p>

<p>“Hello, stranger! I reckon we’re both after the same critter,”
said the hunter who stood on the edge of the little
glade.</p>

<p>“Yes; it ’pears so,” replied the other, who stood by the
deer.</p>

<p>There was something apparently in the voice of the last
comer that impressed the first favorably, for he dropped the
butt of his rifle to the ground, though he still kept his foot
upon the deer’s carcass.</p>

<p>“Well, stranger, we can’t both have the game. I think I
hit him, an’ of course, as it is but nat’ral, you think so, too.
So I reckon we’d better find out which one of us he belongs
to; ’cause I don’t want him if my ball didn’t finish him, an’ of
course, you don’t want him if he’s mine by right,” said the
second hunter, approaching the other fearlessly.</p>

<p>“You’re right, by hookey!” cried the other, yielding to the
influence of the good-humored tone of the other.</p>

<p>“Let me introduce myself, stranger, ’cos you seem to be a
new-comer round hyer,” said the old hunter. “My name’s
Daniel Boone; mayhap you’ve heard of me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon I have!” exclaimed the other, in astonishment.
“Thar’s few men on the border but what have heard
on you. I’m right glad to see you, kurnel.”</p>

<p>“How may I call your name?” asked Boone, who had taken
a fancy to the brawny stranger.</p>

<p>“Thar’s my mark—my handle,” said the stranger, pointing
as he spoke to the name carved on the tree-trunk by which
the deer had fallen; “that’s me.”</p>

<p>Boone cast his eye upon the tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20The%20Wolf%20Demon,%20by%20Albert%20W.%20Aiken_files/i02.jpg" alt="ABE LARK HIS MARK" width="250" height="193">
</div>

<p>Such was the inscription blazoned upon the trunk of the
oak.</p>

<p>“You see, kurnel, the buck evidently thought that it was a
ball from my rifle that ended him, ’cos he laid down to die
right under my name,” said the hunter, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Abe Lark!” Boone read the inscription upon the tree
aloud.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s me, kurnel; your’n to command,” replied the
hunter.</p>

<p>“Stranger in these parts?” questioned Boone.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the other; “I’ve jest come down from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
north. I camped hyar last night, an’ this morning I jest put
my mark onto the tree, so that folks might know that I was
round.”</p>

<p>“I’m right glad to meet you,” and Boone shook hands
warmly with the stranger hunter. “And while you’re in
these parts, just take up your quarters with me. I’m stopping
down yonder, at Point Pleasant, on a visit to some
friends of mine.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t mind, kurnel; I’ll take your invitation in
the same good spirit that you offer it,” said Lark.</p>

<p>“Now for the deer; let’s see who the animal belongs to,”
cried Boone, kneeling down by the carcass.</p>

<p>“Why, kurnel, I resign all claim. It ain’t for me to dispute
with Kurnel Boone!” exclaimed Lark.</p>

<p>“Resign your claim?” cried Boone, in astonishment. “Not
by a jugful. I’ll wager my rifle ag’in’ a popgun that you’re
as good a hand at the rifle as myself. It’s just as likely to be
your deer as mine.”</p>

<p>Then the two carefully examined the carcass. They found
the marks of the two bullets easily; both had struck the animal
just behind the shoulder, but on opposite sides. It was
difficult to determine which had inflicted the death-wound.</p>

<p>“Well, now, this would puzzle a lawyer,” muttered Boone.</p>

<p>“S’pose we divide the animal, share and share alike,” said
Lark.</p>

<p>“That’s squar’,” replied Boone. “We’ll take the buck
in to the station. By the way, what’s the news from the
upper settlements?”</p>

<p>“Well, nothing particular, ’cept that the red devils are on
the war-path ag’in,” replied Lark.</p>

<p>Boone was astonished at the news.</p>

<p>“On the war-path ag’in, eh? What tribe?”</p>

<p>“The Shawnees and the Wyandots.”</p>

<p>“The Shawnees and the Wyandots!” cried Boone: “then
we’ll see fire and smell gunpowder round these parts before
long.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” said the other.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad that you have brought the news. We’ll
be able to prepare for the imps.”</p>

<p>“You can depend upon it,” said Lark; “a friend of mine
has been right through the Shawnee country. They are
coming down onto the settlements in greater force than was
ever known before. They’ve been stirred up by the British
on the border. I did heer say that the British Governor
agrees to give so much apiece for white scalps to the red savages.”</p>

<p>“The eternal villain!” cried Boone, indignantly.</p>

<p>“The Injuns are a-goin’ to try to wipe out all the settlements
on the Ohio. It will be a blood-time while it lasts,”
said Lark, soberly.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to face it,” replied Boone. “Did your friend
hear what chief was goin’ to lead the expedition ag’in’ us on
the south?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Ke-ne-ha-ha.”</p>

<p>“The-man-that-walks,” said Boone, thoughtfully. “He’s
one of the best warriors in all the Shawnee nation. Blood
will run like water along our borders, I’m afeard.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the renegade, Simon Girty, is to guide the Injuns.”</p>

<p>“If I had him within reach of my rifle once, he’d never
guide another Injun expedition ag’in’ his own flesh and blood,”
said Boone, and his hand closed tightly around the rifle-barrel.</p>

<p>“I was jest on my way to the settlement at Point Pleasant
when I started up the buck this morning,” said Lark.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m right glad that it happened as it did, ’cos I
shouldn’t have had the pleasure of meetin’ you,” said Boone.
“Now, s’pose we swing the buck on a pole an’ tote it in to
the station. I reasonably expect that there’ll be some white
faces over yonder when they hear that Ke-ne-ha-ha an’ his
Shawnees, to say nothin’ of Girty, are on the war-path.”</p>

<p>“There ought to be good men enough along the Ohio to
whip any force these red devils can bring,” said Lark.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re awful scattered, but I reckon that now that
we know what’s goin’ on, we can get men enough to give the
Shawnees all the fighting that they want.”</p>

<p>Then the two slung the buck on a pole and started to the
station known as Point Pleasant.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE SECRET FOE.</span></h2>


<p>In the pleasant valley of the Scioto, near what is now the
town of Chillicothe, stood the principal village of the great
Shawnee nation—the Indian tribe that could bring ten thousand
warriors into the field—deadly enemies of the pale-faced
intruder.</p>

<p>All was bustle within the Indian village. To one used to
the Indian customs, it would have been plain that the red-skins
were preparing for the war-path.</p>

<p>The village was alive with warriors. Gayly-painted savages,
decked with ocher and vermilion, strutted proudly up
and down, eagerly waiting for the time to come when, like
tigers, they could spring upon the pale-faces and redden their
weapons with the blood of their hated foes.</p>

<p>Over the village ruled the great chief, Ke-ne-ha-ha, or “The-man-that-walks”—so
termed, first, because he was reputed to
be the fastest runner of any red braves in the Ohio valley,
Shawnee, Wyandot or Mingo; second, that when a youth, on
his first war-path against the Hurons, he had stolen by night
into the midst of a Huron village, literally walked among the
sleeping warriors, and brought back to his comrades the scalp
of a great Huron chief, whom he had dispatched without alarming
the sleepers—the greatest warrior in all the Shawnee
nation—a chief wise in council, brave on the war-path, and
wily as the red fox.</p>

<p>In the village of the red-men were two whose skins were
white, though they were Indians at heart. The two were
renegades from their country and their kin.</p>

<p>These two stood together by the river’s bank, and idly
watched the daring and howling warriors. They were dressed
in the Indian fashion, and were sinewy, powerful men in
build.</p>

<p>The taller of the two, whose hair and eyes were dark, was
called Simon Girty. At one time he had been reputed to be
one of the best scouts on the border, but, for some reason, he
had forsaken the settlements and found a home with the fierce
red-men of the forest-wild, giving up home, country, friends,
every thing. He had been adopted into the Indian tribe, and
none of his red-skinned brothers seemed to bear as deadly a
hatred to the whites as this renegade, Simon Girty.</p>

<p>His companion was not quite so tall, or as stoutly built.
He was called David Kendrick, and was an adopted son of
the Shawnees, as Girty was of the Wyandots.</p>

<p>“This is going to be a bloody business,” said Girty, as he
surveyed the yelling Indians, who were busy in the “scalp-dance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, our chief, Ke-ne-ha-ha, has sworn to break the
power of the whites along the Ohio. The braves are well
provided with arms by the British Governor. Kentucky never
saw such a force upon her border as this will be,” replied the
other.</p>

<p>“The more the better,” said the renegade, Girty, moodily.</p>

<p>Then a howl of anguish rung through the Indian village.
The braves stopped their sports to listen. They knew the signal
well: it was the wail for the dead. It told that some Shawnee
warrior had gone to the spirit-land.</p>

<p>The cry of anguish came from a party of braves entering
the village from the south. In their midst they bore what
seemed, to the eyes of the renegades, a human body.</p>

<p>The warriors deposited their burden before the door of the
council-lodge.</p>

<p>Attracted by the death-note, Ke-ne-ha-ha, the great chief
of the Shawnees, came from his lodge.</p>

<p>The chief was a splendid specimen of a man. He stood
nearly six feet in hight, and was as straight as an arrow. He
was quite light in hue for an Indian, and his features were
intelligent and finely cut.</p>

<p>Astonishment flashed from his eyes as he gazed upon the
face of the dead Indian, around whom, at a respectful distance,
were grouped the Shawnee warriors.</p>

<p>The chief recognized the features of the brave known as
Little Crow, a stout warrior, and reputed to be one of the best
fighting-men in all the Shawnee nation.</p>

<p>“Wah!” said the chief, in a tone that betrayed deep astonishment,
“the soul of the Little Crow has gone to the spirit-land—he
rests in Manitou’s bosom. Let my braves speak—who
has taken the life of the Shawnee warrior?”</p>

<p>“Let the chief open his ears and he shall hear,” replied one
of the braves, a tall, muscular warrior, known as Watega.
“Little Crow went forth, last night, to hunt the deer in the
woods of the Scioto. He was a great warrior; his arm was
strong—his feet swift on the trail. He told his brothers that
he would return before the spirit-lights (stars) died. He did
not come. His brothers sought for him. By the banks of the
Scioto they found him, but the hatchet of a foe had taken the
life of the Little Crow.”</p>

<p>Then the chief knelt by the side of the body and examined
the wound in the head; the clotted blood marked the spot.</p>

<p>The head of the chief had been split open by a single blow,
and that dealt by a giant’s hand. The wound had apparently
been made by a tomahawk, and, as the chief guessed, the
dead man had been attacked suddenly, and from the rear.</p>

<p>“Did my warriors find no trail of the enemy who took the
life of their brother?” asked the chief, still keeping his position
by the body, and with a puzzled look upon his face.</p>

<p>“Wah!—the Shawnee braves have eyes—they are not blind,
like owls in the light. When they found the Little Crow
dead, they looked for the track of the foe. They found footprints
by the body, but the trail came from nowhere and went
nowhere.”</p>

<p>“And the footprints—Indian or pale-face?”</p>

<p>“Pale-face, but the moccasins of the red-man,” answered
the brave.</p>

<p>The brow of the chief grew dark. A white foe so near the
village of the Shawnee, and so daring as to attack and kill
one of the best warriors of the tribe, apparently without a
struggle, must needs be looked after.</p>

<p>“My braves must hunt down the pale-face that wears the
moccasin of the Indian and uses the tomahawk,” said the
chief, gravely.</p>

<p>Then Ke-ne-ha-ha drew aside the blanket that was wrapt
around the body of the dead brave. A cry of horror broke
from the lips of the great chief, and was re-echoed by the surrounding
Indians when they gazed upon the naked breast of
the dead warrior.</p>

<p>“<em>The totem of the Wolf Demon!</em>” exclaimed the chief.</p>

<p>The circle of friends gazed upon the mysterious mark in
silent consternation. Their staring eyes and fear-stricken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
countenances showed plainly how deeply they were interested.</p>

<p>And what was the totem of the Wolf Demon?</p>

<p>On the naked breast of the brawny dead chief were three
slashes, apparently made by a knife, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20eBook%20of%20The%20Wolf%20Demon,%20by%20Albert%20W.%20Aiken_files/i03.jpg" alt="Red Arrow" width="250" height="82">
</div>

<p>And the blood, congealing on the skin, formed a Red Arrow.</p>

<p>It was the totem of the Wolf Demon—the invisible and
fatal scourge of the great Shawnee nation. Thus he marked
his victims.</p>

<p>The chief arose with a troubled look upon his haughty
face.</p>

<p>“Let my people sing the death-song, for a brave warrior
has gone to the spirit-land. Ke-ne-ha-ha will seek the counsel
of the Great Medicine Man, so that he may learn how to
fight the Wolf Demon, who has stricken unto death the great
braves of the Shawnee nation, and put the totem of the Red
Arrow upon their breast.”</p>

<p>Sorrowfully the warriors obeyed the words of the chief,
and soon the sound of lamentation wailed out loud on the
air, which, but a moment before, had resounded with the glad
shouts of triumph.</p>

<p>Slowly and with knitted brows Ke-ne-ha-ha betook himself
to the lodge of the old Indian who was the Great Medicine
Man of the Shawnee tribe.</p>

<p>The death of one of the principal warriors of his tribe by
the dreaded hand of the Wolf Demon, almost within the
very precincts of his village, and at the moment when he
was preparing to set out on his expedition against the whites,
seemed like an omen of evil. A dark cloud descended upon
his soul, despite all his efforts to remove it.</p>

<p>The two renegades had joined the circle around the dead
Indian, and had listened to the story of how he met his death.
Then, when the circle had broken up, they had slowly walked
back again to their former position by the bank of the
river.</p>

<p>A puzzled look was upon Girty’s face. After they had
resumed their former station, he spoke:</p>

<p>“Dave, the words of the chief are a mystery to me, though
the Indians seem to understand them well enough. What did
he mean when he spoke of the Wolf Demon? and what did
that mark of a Red Arrow, cut on the breast of the dead Indian,
mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know?” asked the other, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“No; you forget that for the past six months I have been
at upper Sandusky, with the Wyandots.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and it is just about six months since the Wolf Demon
first appeared.”</p>

<p>“Explain,” said Girty, unable to guess the mystery.</p>

<p>“I will. For the past six months some mysterious being
has singled out the warriors of the Shawnee tribe for his
victims. He always seems to take them by surprise; single
warriors alone he attacks. And on the breast of those he
kills he leaves, as his mark, three slashes with a knife forming
a Red Arrow, like the one you saw on this fellow.”</p>

<p>“But the name of the Wolf Demon?”</p>

<p>“I will explain. One Indian alone has lived to tell of an
encounter with this mysterious slayer. He was only stunned,
and recovered. He reported that he was attacked by a huge
gray wolf, with a man’s head—the face painted black and
white. The wolf stood on its hind legs like a man, but in
hight far out-topping any human. He caught a glimpse of
the monster as it struck him down with a tomahawk that the
beast held in its paws. And that’s the story of the Wolf
Demon, who has killed some of the bravest warriors of the
Shawnee nation.”</p>

<p>“But what do you think it is?”</p>

<p>“I reckon it’s the devil,” said the renegade, solemnly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">A TIMELY SHOT.</span></h2>


<p>From one of the largest of the dwellings that composed
the little frontier settlement of Point Pleasant came a young
girl.</p>

<p>She was about sixteen, and was as pretty as one of the
wild flowers that bloom unseen amid the rocky ravines through
which ran the tumultuous Kanawha.</p>

<p>Dark-brown hair rippled in wavy masses back from her
olive-tinged brow, browned by exposure to the free winds of
the wilderness and the sunbeams that danced so merrily over
the surface of the rolling river.</p>

<p>The bright color in the cheeks of the girl, her free step,
that possessed all the grace and lightness of the bounding
fawn, told of perfect health, as also did the sparkling brown
eyes and rose-red lips that seemed to hold such dewy sweetness
in their graceful curves.</p>

<p>The maiden was known as Virginia Treveling. She was
the daughter of General Lemuel Treveling, a man who had
great experience as an Indian-fighter on the Western border,
and who had settled down in Point Pleasant, and was reputed
to be by far the wealthiest man in all the country
around.</p>

<p>So, by virtue of her father’s wealth, as well as by the aid
of her own beauty, Virginia Treveling was the belle of the
station known as Point Pleasant.</p>

<p>Her right to the title was not disputed, and few envied her,
for Virginia was as good as she was beautiful.</p>

<p>Many of the young men of Point Pleasant and of the
neighboring stations had sought to gain the favor of the winsome
maid, but to all she said, <em>nay</em>!</p>

<p>The man to whom the fair girl would freely give her heart
had not yet met her eye; but Virginia was young—scarcely
old enough to be wooed and won.</p>

<p>The maid was clad in simple homespun garments, the
work of her own hands, for she was a true American girl, a
daughter of the frontier, and looked not with favor upon the
gaudy trappings of fashion.</p>

<p>The little tin pail that she carried in her hand told her mission.</p>

<p>The great blackberries were shining in huge purple clusters
in the rocky passes that surrounded Point Pleasant, and,
like the fortifications of the olden time, seemed to forbid approach.</p>

<p>With her light, graceful step, the girl passed through the
village, and taking the trail that led to the south, along the
bank of the stream, soon left the settlement behind.</p>

<p>There was little danger in this incursion into the deep
woods, for the Indians were on the northern bank of the
Ohio; and then, too, there had been peace between the settlements
and their red neighbors for some time.</p>

<p>The girl followed the trail for about half a mile, then,
turning abruptly to the east, entered a little defile, where the
blackberries grew thick and rank.</p>

<p>Picking the berries as she went slowly along, she soon lost
sight of the trail leading from the town.</p>

<p>The maiden had not been gone from the path many minutes
when the hoof-stroke of a horse rung out with a dull
“thud” on the still air of the forest.</p>

<p>A horseman was approaching from the south. A traveler,
probably, from Virginia.</p>

<p>Then the horseman came into sight. He was a young
man, dressed plainly in a homespun suit of blue. Upon his
head he wore a broad-leafed felt hat, that shaded the sun
from his eyes. A short, German rifle, carrying a ball of
forty to the pound, and richly ornamented on the stock with
silver, was resting across his saddle in front of him. A
keen-edged hunting-knife, the blade some eighteen inches
in length, was thrust through the leather belt that girded in
his waist.</p>

<p>The face of the young horseman was a frank and honest
one. The full, steel-blue eyes showed plainly both courage
and firmness. The handsome, resolute mouth confirmed
this.</p>

<p>In figure, the rider was about the medium size, but
his well-built, sinewy form gave promise of great muscular
power.</p>

<p>The rider was named Harvey Winthrop. A descendant
was he of one of the staunch old Puritan fathers. And now
he was seeking his fortune in the far Western wilds, for the
fickle goddess had not smiled upon the young man. A student
at a foreign university, he had been hurriedly called
home by the sickness of his father, his only parent. He arrived
just in time to close that father’s eyes. And when he
came to settle up his parent’s estate, instead of finding himself—as
he had expected—the possessor of a goodly fortune,
he discovered that some few hundred dollars was all in the
world that he could call his own.</p>

<p>Young Harvey Winthrop, though, had the right stuff in his
nature. Bidding his friends adieu, he set forth to make new
ones, and to carve out for himself a fortune by the banks of
the “Beautiful River” the Ohio.</p>

<p>So it is that, on that pleasant summer’s day, the young Bostonian
found himself on the trail leading to Point Pleasant,
and was fast approaching that station.</p>

<p>“The settlement can not be far off now,” he said, musing
to himself as he rode along, and, rising in his stirrups, he
strove with his gaze to penetrate through the mazes of the almost
trackless forest before him.</p>

<p>Then, to the astonished ears of the young man came a woman’s
scream, evidently given under great alarm.</p>

<p>The traveler checked his horse and snatched the rifle from
the saddle.</p>

<p>Again on the still air rung out the scream, shrilly, coupled
with a cry for help. The cry came from the ravine on the
right.</p>

<p>In a second he leaped from the saddle, and, rifle in hand,
plunged into the ravine. His horse—a well-trained beast—remained
motionless on the spot where his rider had left him.</p>

<p>The young man dashed up the steep ascent at break-neck
speed.</p>

<p>The noise made by his steps fell upon the ears of the woman
who uttered the scream. She knew that help was near.</p>

<p>A few steps more and the young man beheld a scene which
nearly froze his blood with horror.</p>

<p>Fleeing down the ravine came a young girl—who, even at
this moment of excitement, he noticed was beautiful, almost
beyond expression; and behind her, in full pursuit, was a huge
black bear.</p>

<p>The girl was Virginia Treveling. In her search for berries
she had stumbled upon the bear, who was busily engaged
feasting upon the luscious fruit.</p>

<p>But Bruin, in a twinkling, forsook the berries for the human.</p>

<p>Then from the lips of the girl came the shrill screams that
had brought the traveler to her rescue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl reached the young man.</p>

<p>“Keep on, Miss,” he cried, quickly; “fly for your life! I’ll
keep the brute at bay.”</p>

<p>Small time was there for conversation, for the bear, at his
lumbering trot, was coming rapidly onward.</p>

<p>“He will kill you!” cried the terrified girl.</p>

<p>“Yes, and you, too, if you don’t run,” said the young man,
coolly. “One life is enough; so save yours.”</p>

<p>“I will not go!” exclaimed the girl. “Give me your
powder flask and a bullet. After you fire, if you miss him,
I can load.”</p>

<p>The hunter threw a glance of admiration at the heroic maid
who seemed so cool at this moment of danger; but he did as
she requested. Then, as the bear came on, he leveled his
rifle at the brute, and sighting one of his eyes, fired. But
the bear swerving in its course at the moment, the ball glanced
across his bony head and shot off as if it had been but a boy’s
marble.</p>

<p>The beast paused for an instant, shook its head as if annoyed,
then, with an angry growl, he came straight upon the
young man.</p>

<p>Winthrop had handed his rifle to the girl, and, drawing
his knife, awaited the onset. His only hope of escape
was to close in with the animal, and stab him in some vital
part before he could use the terrible claws and teeth.</p>

<p>The bear reared on its hind legs and prepared to seize the
young man with open mouth.</p>

<p>Winthrop felt that the crisis had come.</p>

<p>The young man raised his knife to plunge it into the shaggy
breast before him, while, with eager but trembling hands, the
girl reloaded the rifle.</p>

<p>But the sharp crack of a rifle came quick on the air.</p>

<p>Winthrop heard the “hiss” of a bullet that whirled past,
close to his ear. Then, with a grunt of agony, the bear fell
over on its side, clawed the air wildly for a moment—growled
in pain, and sunk into the silence of death.</p>

<p>The rifle-ball which had passed so near to the ear of the
young man had entered the body of the bear between the
fore-legs and buried itself in the great red heart.</p>

<p>Winthrop could hardly believe his eyes when he beheld
the grim king of the forest lying in death at his feet; when
he saw the huge paws motionless that he had expected to feel
tearing his own flesh.</p>

<p>He had been saved almost by a miracle.</p>

<p>A timely shot, and a good one, for an inch either way
would have missed the heart of the bear or killed the young
hunter.</p>

<p>Winthrop felt that both he and the beautiful girl had been
saved by the shot of the, as yet, hidden friend.</p>

<p>The young man looked for his preserver. Judge of his astonishment
when forth from the bushes that fringed the rocks,
with a rifle in hand—a very forest queen—came a young girl!</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE GIRL THAT FIRED THE SHOT.</span></h2>


<p>Winthrop looked with amazed eyes upon his preserver,
for that the girl had saved his life by coming so timely to his
rescue, there was hardly a doubt.</p>

<p>The young man saw a beautiful girl, clad in the Indian
fashion, her garb gayly fringed and decorated with colored
beads. But though clad in the garb of the Indian, more
white blood than red leaped in the veins of the forest child.</p>

<p>Her skin was of a rich olive tinge; a peculiar skin—so
thin, despite its darkness, that it showed the quick play of
the surging blood in the veins beneath.</p>

<p>Dark-brown hair floated in tangled masses from the fillet
of deer-skin, adorned with eagle-plumes, that encircled her
head. Her eyes were dark brown in their hue, and large and
full as the eyes of the deer.</p>

<p>Grace was in every motion, yet one could easily see that
the graceful limbs were strong and sinewy—muscles of steel
beneath the silken skin.</p>

<p>Lightly the girl bounded down, from rock to rock, until she
reached the bottom of the defile wherein stood the two by the
carcass of the dead bear who had fallen by the rifle of this
forest fay.</p>

<p>Nor was Virginia less astonished at the sudden appearance
of the dark-hued maiden than the young stranger.</p>

<p>She gazed with amazement on the girl who was so unlike
all of her sex in looks and dress.</p>

<p>“A lucky shot!” exclaimed the wood nymph, kneeling by
the side of dead Bruin, and examining the wound that had
given him his death.</p>

<p>“I owe you my life!” cried Winthrop, impulsively; “for
had I once got into the grim hug of the brute, I’m afraid he
would have made sad work of me.”</p>

<p>“No, not to me,” replied the girl, “but to the great One
above who first sent me to your aid, and then gave me the
skill to send the ball home to the heart of the bear.”</p>

<p>“I shall thank you, though, all the same,” replied the
young man. “You have saved my life, and, while I live, I
shall never forget it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of it any more, please,” said the girl, a blush
mantling to her cheeks at the earnest gaze of the young forester.
“You threw yourself into danger to save this young
lady; Heaven sent me to your aid, for it was not right that
you should be sacrificed while acting so nobly.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I must thank you, sir, for periling your life in
my behalf,” said Virginia, in her low, sweet voice, that
thrilled like pleasant music through the heart of the young
adventurer.</p>

<p>“You make me ashamed of my simple service,” replied
Winthrop. “I would have done the same for any one in
peril. It is our duty in this life to help our fellow-creatures,
and I would be unworthy of the name of man had I stood by
and witnessed your peril without making an effort to save
you.”</p>

<p>The forest maiden watched the girl’s face while the young
man was speaking, with a peculiar expression in her dark
eyes.</p>

<p>“I am Virginia, daughter of General Treveling, of Point
Pleasant; if you are going thither, I am sure my father will
thank you heartily for the service you have this day rendered
his only child.”</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> going to Point Pleasant, and shall be pleased to
meet your father, whom I have heard highly spoken of many
times on my way here,” said Winthrop. Then he turned to
the girl in the Indian garb, who stood leaning upon her rifle,
with her eyes intently fixed upon the two. “Lady, may I not
know the name of her whose well-directed shot saved me?
There may come a time when I can repay the service.”</p>

<p>“Do not ask my name,” said the girl, in a mournful tone;
“it is better, perhaps, that you should <em>not</em> know it.”</p>

<p>Winthrop looked his astonishment at this strange speech.</p>

<p>“I really do not see how that can be, lady,” he said, after a
moment’s pause. “I am sure I shall never forget the service,
nor your name, if once I hear it.”</p>

<p>“I repeat that it is better that you should not know it,”
said the girl, slowly.</p>

<p>“Why so?” demanded the young man, while on the face
of Virginia was written strong curiosity to know the meaning
of the girl’s words.</p>

<p>“You think you owe me a debt of gratitude,” said the
dark-hued maiden. “It is a pleasant thought for me to know
that <em>some</em> one thinks well of me. If I tell you my name, perhaps
the gratitude that you now think you owe will vanish,
and in its place will come loathing.”</p>

<p>“You speak in riddles,” said Winthrop, unable to guess her
meaning, but plainly seeing that some mystery was concealed
in her words. “I do not see how the knowledge of your
name will change my sentiments in any way whatsoever. I
beseech you, tell me what it is. I can never forget the name
of the one who saved my life.”</p>

<p>“And you, Virginia Treveling,” said the girl, turning abruptly
to the General’s daughter. “Do you not know who I
am?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Virginia, “but I should like very much to
know, for I feel that, in part, I owe you my life too.”</p>

<p>“Blame yourself, then, if, after I have told you my name,
you shrink from me, and gratitude dies in loathing. <em>I am
Kanawha Kate!</em>”</p>

<p>Virginia started when the name fell upon her ears. The
quick eye of Kate noticed the start. Winthrop did not manifest
any emotion whatever. It was the first time he had
ever heard the name, and though he wondered somewhat at
the strange appellation, still he saw nothing in it to alarm him
in any way.</p>

<p>“You shrink from me,” said Kate, with a bitter smile—she
was referring to the almost unconscious start that Virginia
had made when she heard the name. “You know who I am.
You have heard evil tongues talk of me, and you are not so
grateful now as you were a moment ago.”</p>

<p>“Nay, you wrong me,” said Virginia, gently. “In all my
life I have never heard evil spoken of Kanawha Kate. I
have heard you called wild and wayward—spoken of as one
more like a boy than a girl—who liked to roam about the forest
better than to sit at home. But when I heard the tongues
of the settlers speak lightly of you, I have always remembered
that you were an orphan—without mother or father—with
no one to tell you what you should do.”</p>

<p>“You are right. I have grown up like a weed, uncared for
by all”—there was great bitterness in the tone of the girl’s
voice—“my only relative a renegade from his country and
his race—a white Indian, far worse than the dusky savages.
Why should I not be an outcast, despised by all, when my
unhappy fate dooms me to such a life?”</p>

<p>“No, not despised by all,” said Virginia, firmly. “I do
not despise you; I love you—that is, if you will let me.”
And the girl placed her hand gently on the shoulder of the
other.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thank you so much!” The words came in a half-sob
from the lips of the forest child.</p>

<p>“Let me be your sister. Come and see me at my home at
the station. Few will be bold enough to say aught against
the sister of Virginia Treveling.” Proudly the young girl
drew up her form as she uttered the words.</p>

<p>“Yes, and for want of a better, take me for your brother,”
said Winthrop, impulsively, “and the man who dares to
breathe a word against you will have to face the muzzle of
my rifle.”</p>

<p>“It is many a long day since such kind words have fallen
upon my ears,” said Kate, sadly. “Perhaps I should not be
so wild if my parents had lived. But, Miss Virginia, I will
come and see you.”</p>

<p>“Do, and I promise you a hearty welcome!” exclaimed
Virginia.</p>

<p>“Oh, I <em>will</em> come!” cried Kate, her eyes gleaming.</p>

<p>“Good-by, then,” and the rescued girl turned to Winthrop.
“If you are going to Point Pleasant, I will be your guide,
and I am sure that my father will be very glad to see you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
particularly when he learns that you have saved the life of his
only child!”</p>

<p>Virginia embraced Kate heartily, and kissed her as if she
had been a sister; Winthrop shook her warmly by the hand,
and then the two, leaving the forest maid standing by the
body of the dead brute, retraced their way to the little trail
that led to Point Pleasant.</p>

<p>Kate, leaning on her rifle, remained in a deep reverie, gazing
absently upon their departing figures.</p>

<p>Winthrop found his horse exactly where he had left him.
Passing the bridle over his arm, he walked by the side of Virginia
toward the station.</p>

<p>“What a strange creature that girl is,” he said, as they
walked onward.</p>

<p>“Yes; I have often heard of her, though I have never happened
to meet her before. The settlers tell a great many
stories about her. They say that she can ride better than any
man on the border. That she knows every foot of the country
for miles around, even to the Indian villages on the other side
of the Ohio. Then, too, they say she is a splendid shot with
the rifle, and can use the hunting-knife like a woodman.”</p>

<p>“We can vouch for her skill in marksmanship,” said Winthrop,
and a half-shiver came over him when he thought of
the huge bear, with its fierce eyes and shining teeth.</p>

<p>“Yes; poor girl, she is a niece of the renegade, Simon
Girty, and that, I think, makes the settlers dislike her—as if
she should answer for the misdeeds of her wicked uncle!”
Virginia spoke with feeling; her face lighted up, and Winthrop
thought that he had never looked upon a prettier
maiden.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">VIRGINIA’S SUITOR.</span></h2>


<p>In the best room of Treveling’s house sat the old General
and a young man, known as Clement Murdock. He was a
relative of Treveling, and was much esteemed by the old
General.</p>

<p>General Treveling was a man of fifty. Years had whitened
the hair of the old soldier and bent the once stalwart form.</p>

<p>Murdock was some thirty years old—a dark, sallow-faced
man, with a piercing black eye and a haughty bearing.</p>

<p>The young man had just entered, and returning the General’s
cordial greeting, had taken a seat by his side.</p>

<p>“What’s the news?” asked Treveling.</p>

<p>“Nothing particular, General,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“Nothing fresh from the red-skins? It’s about time for
them to be on the war-path against us again.”</p>

<p>“They have not forgotten the thrashing they got last year,
I suppose,” said the young man. “But I want to speak with
you on a subject which I have thought a great deal of lately.”</p>

<p>The old General looked astonished at this beginning.</p>

<p>“Very well, what is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“In regard to your daughter, Virginia, General,” said
Murdock, slowly. “I would like your permission to pay my
addresses to her. I have long loved your daughter, and I
should like to make her my wife.”</p>

<p>“Well, Clement, you know that you have my best wishes.
There isn’t a man in the settlement that I would rather give
my child to. But, win her consent: <em>that</em> comes first, of
course. If she is willing, I shall not object.”</p>

<p>The joy of Murdock plainly showed itself in his face.</p>

<p>“That is all I ask, General,” he said, quickly. “I thought
it but right that you should know my intentions first.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have my good will, Clement,” said the old
soldier, “and I do not doubt but that you will find favor in
the eyes of Virginia. She will be home soon. She has gone
for blackberries down the river.”</p>

<p>And as the father spoke the door opened and Virginia entered,
followed by the young adventurer, Harvey Winthrop.</p>

<p>“Oh, father, I have had such an escape,” said the maiden,
quickly; then she gave an account of her adventure in the
forest with the bear.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, I owe you the life of my child!” cried the General,
earnestly, when the girl had finished her story. “How
may I call your name?”</p>

<p>“Winthrop—Harvey Winthrop, an adventurer seeking his
fortune on the border,” replied the young man.</p>

<p>“You must drive your stakes with us, for a short time,
at least, if we can not induce you to make Point Pleasant
your permanent home,” said the old soldier, heartily. “I am
General Treveling, sir; this, my daughter, Virginia, and this
gentleman a relative of ours, Clement Murdock.”</p>

<p>Although Murdock shook hands in a friendly way with the
stranger who had rescued his fair cousin from the bear, yet,
in his heart, he wished him at the bottom of the Ohio. Was
Clement afraid that the handsome stranger would interfere
with his plans regarding the gentle Virginia?</p>

<p>Frankly—in the same spirit that it was given—Winthrop
accepted the invitation of the old soldier. Perhaps, too, the
thought that he should enjoy the society of the fair girl,
whose life he had saved, had something to do with his ready
acceptance of the hospitality of the old General.</p>

<p>Leaving her father and Winthrop engaged in busy conversation,
Virginia withdrew into the inner room. Murdock,
seizing the opportunity, followed. He had resolved to declare
his passion at once. He had been an open and avowed
lover of Virginia’s for some time. In fact, all the settlers
thought it would be a match. And Murdock, though he did
not openly say that he was the accepted suitor of the General’s
daughter, yet by many a sly hint he contrived to impress
all with that belief. So, one by one, his rivals for the
girl’s favor had withdrawn from the contest, and left the field
clear to the scheming lover.</p>

<p>Yet now, even at the eleventh hour, when he had thought
the hand of the girl was his beyond a doubt, this young
stranger had stepped into the field, and that under such circumstances
that the girl’s gratitude if not her love must be
surely his.</p>

<p>Murdock was sorely annoyed at the accident which had
given the young man such a claim to the girl’s esteem. He
determined, however, to ask for the hand of the girl at
once.</p>

<p>Virginia turned in some little astonishment when she discovered
that she was followed by Clement.</p>

<p>He carefully closed the door behind him and approached
the young girl.</p>

<p>“Virginia,” he said, in his softest and smoothest tones, “I
have long wished for an opportunity to tell you how much I
love you. I have spoken to your father, and he approves
my suit. Virginia, can you give me the priceless treasure of
your love? Will you be my wife?”</p>

<p>The girl flushed to the temples at the words of Murdock.
She had suspected that he sought her, but had carefully
avoided leading him to think that she favored his suit. For,
to tell the truth, the young girl did not love but rather feared
him. There was a bad look in the fierce black eyes, and ugly
lines about the sensual mouth, and these things she had noticed.
In her heart Virginia thought that Murdock was far
from being a good man.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Mr. Murdock, that you have spoken in this
way to me,” said the girl, slowly, and with evident embarrassment.
“It grieves me that I must pain you with a refusal. I
can not accept the love that you offer.”</p>

<p>Murdock started in anger, and the frown that knit his brows
showed plainly his deep displeasure.</p>

<p>“Are you in earnest?” he asked, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Surely I am,” replied the girl. She did not like the tone
in which the question was put.</p>

<p>“Had you not better take time to think over the matter?”
he said. “You may change your mind.”</p>

<p>“That is not likely,” she answered, coldly. “I can decide
now as well as any time in the future. I feel that I can not
love you.”</p>

<p>“Do you love any one else?” he asked, quickly.</p>

<p>A faint flush came to the cheeks of the girl, which did not
escape the jealous eyes of the rejected lover.</p>

<p>“You have no right to ask that question,” she cried.</p>

<p>“Will you answer it?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No!” repeated Virginia, all the fire of her nature roused
by the insolent manner of the man who stood lowering before
her.</p>

<p>“You do not dare to answer it.”</p>

<p>“It is no business of yours what my motive is,” replied
Virginia, proudly.</p>

<p>“You fancy yourself in love with some one. You can not
deceive me. Let your lover look to himself. If you can not
be my wife, I swear that you shall not be the wife of any
other man. You are a beautiful girl, Virginia, but your
beauty will be fatal to the mortal that dares to cross my path!”
Murdock spoke in heat, and the angry glare of a demon shot
from his fierce black eyes.</p>

<p>“If I have a lover, he will be able to defend himself from
the coward who only dares to threaten a woman!” And
with these words Virginia swept proudly from the room.</p>

<p>“By all the powers of darkness, I swear that I will find
means to bend your haughty spirit, and on your knees you
will be glad to ask my pardon for those proud words!” cried
the baffled lover, his voice hoarse with rage.</p>

<p>Then he left the house by the back door and gained the
street. He did not care to meet the eyes of the old General,
for he readily guessed that his discomfiture would easily be
perceived.</p>

<p>“Who can this lover be?” he mused, as he walked slowly
down the street. “Can it be this young stranger who saved
her from the bear in the ravine? It may be. I am sure that
there isn’t a lad on the border that is favored by her, for I
have watched her closely. Is the prize then that I have toiled
so to gain to be snatched from my hand by this adventurer?
She must marry me, or—<em>she must die</em>! She is the
only obstacle between me and the fortune of the old General.
That fortune I am determined to have, and the silly caprice
of a weak girl shall not keep me from it.”</p>

<p>Stern and frowning was the brow of Clement Murdock as
he strode along. Dark and gloomy thoughts were passing
rapidly through his mind.</p>

<p>“The die is cast—I have decided,” he muttered, as he
walked onward. “First to find <em>who</em> this lover is, that has
crossed my path—for that the girl has a lover or is in love
with some one, I am certain. I marked the slight flush that
crimsoned her cheek when I charged her with loving another;
that blush revealed to me the truth. I have a rival,
and a dangerous one, for she loves him. I <em>must</em> discover who
it is. If the young adventurer is the man, let him look to
himself, for the fortune that he comes to seek by the banks
of the Ohio, may resolve itself into a grave in the forest with
the gaunt gray wolves as mourners. True, the acquaintanceship
is but a few hours old, but love comes at first sight,
sometimes. The fortune of my relative shall be mine, either
with Virginia or without her. I must find some willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
tools to aid me, for I feel a presentiment that I shall have
need of strong arms and reckless hearts, ere long.”</p>

<p>Then the eyes of Murdock caught sight of a little group
of settlers at the lower end of the station near the bank of
the Kanawha.</p>

<p>“Hallo! what’s the meaning of that I wonder?” he exclaimed;
“there’s evidently some trouble afloat. Another
Indian attack, perhaps. I must see what it is.” And he advanced
to the group.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">ANOTHER VICTIM.</span></h2>


<p>As Murdock approached the group, he saw that Colonel
Boone and a strange hunter were in the center of the party.</p>

<p>Another strange face also met the eye of the new-comer.
It was that of a man attired in the homespun dress of the
emigrant. His hair was jet-black, and his skin tanned almost
as dark as the hue of a red-skin. He stood on the outer
edge of the group, leaning on a long rifle. The keen, dark
eyes of this stranger had a restless look, and wandered continually
about him.</p>

<p>Murdock felt sure, the moment he beheld the face of the
stranger that he had seen him before somewhere, but, for
the life of him, he could not guess when or where. Slowly
he drew nigh, keeping a wary eye upon the hunter-emigrant.</p>

<p>Boone had been telling the settlers the news imparted to
him by the solitary hunter whom he had encountered in the
forest in such a peculiar manner, and who was called Abe
Lark.</p>

<p>“The Shawnees again on the war-path!” cried a stalwart
settler, known as Jacob Jackson, and renowned as an Indian-fighter.</p>

<p>As Boone had predicted, there were white faces among the
settlers when they heard the terrible news.</p>

<p>“True as shootin’!” cried Boone, “an’ comin’ ag’in’ us in
bigger numbers than has ever been seen on the border since
we licked ’em right hyer in the Dunmore war.”</p>

<p>A heavy frown came over the face of the stranger, who
stood a little apart from the others, as Boone mentioned the
battle of Point Pleasant. It was evident that the mention of
that bloody fight brought back some unpleasant recollections
to the mind of the stranger.</p>

<p>Murdock was watching the man closely, but he was careful
not to betray to the stranger that he was being watched.</p>

<p>“Who leads the red-skins?” asked Jackson.</p>

<p>“Ke-ne-ha-ha,” replied Boone.</p>

<p>“The-man-that-walks!” said Jackson.</p>

<p>And at the name the faces of the whites grew serious.
They knew full well that a better chieftain than the Shawnee
never donned the war-paint, and that the whites had no abler
or more deadly foe than Ke-ne-ha-ha.</p>

<p>“Thar’ll be lightnin’ all round then, for sure,” said Jackson,
in a tone of conviction. “We’ve got to fight doggoned
well to whip the Shawnees this time. Who fetched the news,
kurnel?”</p>

<p>“This stranger, hyer,” replied Boone, pointing to Abe
Lark, who stood by his side.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, stranger,” said Jackson, tendering his
huge paws and receiving a grip that made him wince with
pain, muscular and hard as his horny palm was.</p>

<p>“Same to you, ole hoss,” returned Lark, with a grin on his
disfigured face at the expression of astonishment that came
over the features of burly Jake Jackson, when he received
the powerful squeeze of Lark’s hand.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem!” muttered Jake, looking at his hand in amazement,
“that’s a reg’lar b’ar-hug an’ no mistake.”</p>

<p>“Wal, I reckon the man that gits a grip from me knows it,”
replied Lark.</p>

<p>“Well, ’bout this news. Are you sartin, stranger, that the
red devils are a-comin’ ag’in’ us?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t hear the Shawnee war-whoop inside of ten
days you kin jist chaw one of my fingers off, an’ I don’t keer
which you take,” replied Lark, with another grin.</p>

<p>“Then it will be fight, and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“You kin bet your moccasins on that, an’ you’ll lose ’em
every time. The Shawnees have sworn to wipe out every white
settlement along the Ohio. Thar’ll be nigh onto ten thousand
Injuns in the field. They are hot arter blood. You’ll
have to fight for your top-knots or lose ’em.”</p>

<p>A bitter look was on the face of the dark-skinned stranger
as he listened to the words of Lark.</p>

<p>“Curses on this meddling hunter!” he muttered, between
his teeth; “how could he have learned of Ke-ne-ha-ha’s plan
to surprise this station. Now, thanks to him, they’ll be on
their guard, and the Shawnees will have to fight for what
scalps they take.”</p>

<p>Not an expression on the face of this stranger was unnoticed
by Murdock, who still watched him keenly, but with a
puzzled look.</p>

<p>“Can it be possible that it is he?” Murdock mused.
“<em>Would</em> he dare to venture here in the midst of his foes? To
venture into the presence of the men who, if they penetrated
his disguise, would hang him up to the first tree without
troubling either judge or jury? Yet I am sure it is he,
though his face is darkened by some means, and his hair is
black. He comes as a spy, probably. Ah!” and a brilliant
thought occurred to the mind of Murdock. “Suppose I get
him to aid my plans. He is in my power, if he be the man I
think he is, for a single word uttered by my lips, and the settlers
would almost tear him to pieces. I’ll watch him
closely.” And with this resolution in his mind, Murdock did
not remove his eyes from the stranger. The dark-skinned
hunter was so occupied in watching the group of settlers and
listening to their conversation that he did not notice that he
in turn was watched.</p>

<p>“Well, neighbors,” said Jake Jackson, after thinking for a
moment, “if the Injuns are a-comin’ we’ve got for to fight
’em, an’ I am ready for one.”</p>

<p>“And I for another!” cried a loud, clear voice.</p>

<p>All turned to look at the speaker, who had approached unobserved.
He was a tall, muscular fellow, dressed in the forest
garb of deer-skin.</p>

<p>“Sim Kenton, by the Eternal!” said Boone, taking him
warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>It was indeed the famous scout, whose reputation as an Indian-fighter
was second to none on the border.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, Sim!” continued Boone, and the group
of settlers eagerly echoed the welcome. “What’s the news?”</p>

<p>“Thar’s a thunder-storm a-comin’,” replied the scout. “I
s’pect from what I heerd, as I come up, that you know the
Shawnees are on the war-path.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” cried a dozen voices.</p>

<p>“I’ve just come down from the Muskingum, whar I’ve
been on a hunt, and not five miles from this hyer station, I
come across a big Injun lyin’ dead in the woods with a clean
dig right through the skull. A powerful fellow he war, too;
looked as if he mought have given Old Nick himself a sharp
tussle.”</p>

<p>All wondered at the news brought by the scout. That a
red-skin should be killed so near the station, and yet no one
in the station know of it, was strange.</p>

<p>“What tribe was he? could you tell, Sim?” asked Boone.</p>

<p>“Shawnee,” replied Kenton. “A big brave he was in the
tribe, too. I knowed him well. He was called Watega.”</p>

<p>The dark stranger, who had pressed forward eagerly to listen
with the rest, could hardly prevent an oath escaping from
his lips. This movement on his part did not escape the
searching eyes of Murdock.</p>

<p>“I know the chief,” said Boone; “he was one of the principal
warriors of the tribe. A clean dig through the skull,
you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the man that made it must be a hurricane, for he
split the Injun’s head clean open.”</p>

<p>“Who could have done it?” said Jackson, in wonder.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to know,” said Kenton, with a puzzled
air. “Thar ain’t any man along the border, that I know
of, that is powerful enough for to do it. Thar warn’t any
marks of a struggle, neither. The Injun had been taken by
surprise, an’ settled with one blow. Why, it looks as if the
devil himself had had a hand in it.”</p>

<p>“Nothing but one clean dig, eh?” said Boone, reflectively.</p>

<p>“Nothing else,” replied Kenton, “’cept some knife-cuts on
the breast, as if the slayer cut his totem thar, arter finishing
the brute.”</p>

<p>Boone gave a slight start—a start that was imitated by the
dark-skinned stranger who was listening to the conversation
so eagerly.</p>

<p>“And them marks—three knife-cuts, making a red arrow?”
asked Boone.</p>

<p>“Right to an iota!” cried Kenton, astonished at the knowledge
of the other.</p>

<p>“The Wolf Demon, by hookey!” exclaimed Boone, in a
tone of wonder. And at the name of the dreaded foe of the
Shawnee nation, the dark stranger shuddered.</p>

<p>“What in creation do you mean by the Wolf Demon?”
asked Kenton, who had never heard the story of the mysterious
scourge of the Shawnees, which was well known to
Boone.</p>

<p>Then the old hunter told the wondering crowd the story of
the Wolf Demon. Told of the incomprehensible being in the
shape of a huge gray wolf, but with the face of a man, who
seemed to be an avenging angel destined to hunt down to his
death any solitary Shawnee brave who strayed from his
brethren in the forest.</p>

<p>Wonder-stricken, the stout borderers listened to the tale;
deeply superstitious, they accepted the legend of the Indians
without question; one and all were convinced that the Wolf
Demon was, as the Shawnees asserted, proof against either
steel or ball, and was no human, but a denizen of another
world.</p>

<p>“Whar was the body?” asked Jackson.</p>

<p>“Just beyond a tree where some hunter had cut his name—Abe
Lark,” answered Kenton.</p>

<p>“Wal, we were nigh it this mornin’!” cried Abe, in astonishment.</p>

<p>The dark-skinned stranger, having apparently heard all he
wanted, strolled leisurely away.</p>

<p>Murdock, convinced now that he was not mistaken as to
the identity of the stranger, followed him slowly.</p>

<p>“Let this Wolf Demon come within range of my rifle, I’ll
quickly prove whether he is man or devil,” said the unknown,
as he walked onward. “Watega dead? That interferes with
my plans, but I can do without him, since it must be so.”
And with these strange words on his tongue, he was suddenly
astonished by being hailed by Murdock.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE SCHEME OF CLEMENT MURDOCK.</span></h2>


<p>The stranger turned in no little surprise at being accosted
by the young man.</p>

<p>“Did you speak to me, stranger?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Murdock; “I should like to have a few
minutes’ conversation with you if it is agreeable.”</p>

<p>The stranger shot a rapid glance at the face of the young
man, but he saw nothing therein to alarm him.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he replied, after thinking for a moment.</p>

<p>“This is my shanty,” said Murdock, referring to the log-house
before whose door they stood. “Come in; we can talk
inside without being overheard.”</p>

<p>There was a strange expression upon the face of the other.
He cast a rapid glance around him, and laid his hand upon
the handle of the hunting-knife at his girdle, as if he had half
a mind to stab the young man—who was fumbling with the
rude fastenings of the door—and then make a bold break for
freedom and the woods. But the momentary glance around
convinced him—that is, if he had such an idea—that to carry
it out would be hopeless, for a dozen or more of the settlers
were between him and the forest. So, with a muttered curse
upon his ill luck, he followed Murdock into the cabin.</p>

<p>Murdock produced a flask of whisky and a couple of tin
cups, and motioning his rather unwilling guest to draw near
the table, he pledged him with the fragrant corn-juice.</p>

<p>The stranger tossed off the fiery liquor with a moody brow.
He suspected that he was in a trap, and he felt far from being
easy.</p>

<p>“Do you know that your face is strangely familiar to me?”
asked Murdock, with a meaning smile.</p>

<p>“Indeed! that is strange,” responded the other, half inclined
to spring upon the young man, for he felt a strong apprehension
that his disguise was penetrated.</p>

<p>“I think we have met before,” said Murdock, with another
look full of meaning.</p>

<p>“I don’t remember ever meeting you,” replied the stranger,
who now almost repented that he hadn’t made a bold
dash for freedom when at the door.</p>

<p>“I feel sure that we have met,” said Murdock. “How may
I call your name?”</p>

<p>“James Benton,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“From Virginia?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have never met a Mr. Benton,” said Murdock.</p>

<p>“I was sure that you were in error when you said that you
knew me,” said the stranger, with an air of relief.</p>

<p>“Not as Benton, but under another name, I have met
you.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” The hand of the stranger sought the handle of his
knife. The movement was not unnoticed by the keen eye of
Murdock.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed; I mean you no harm,” he said, quickly.
“If I had wished to denounce you, there wouldn’t have been
any need of bringing you into my house. All that would be
necessary would be to speak your name in the middle of this
station. Why, the very sticks themselves that form the
stockade would rise out of the ground to seize you, to say
nothing of the men.”</p>

<p>“For whom do you take me?” asked the stranger, in a
hoarse voice.</p>

<p>“For the man for whose body, dead or alive, the settlers on
the border would give more than they would for any other
man that walks upon earth, be his skin white or red,” replied
Murdock.</p>

<p>The stranger glanced at him with sullen eyes.</p>

<p>“Be assured, however,” continued the young man, “that I
mean you no harm. On the contrary, I need your aid, and
I’m willing to pay you well for it. Come, is it a bargain?”</p>

<p>“You know my name?” said the stranger, slowly, without
replying to the question.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are—” and Murdock, bending over, whispered a
name in the ear of the stranger. “Am I right?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the stranger, sullenly. “But I cannot understand
how you penetrated my disguise.”</p>

<p>“Particularly when it deceived Boone and a half-score of
your deadly foes, who would be almost willing to give ten
years of their lives to draw a bead on you at fair rifle range.”</p>

<p>“That is possible,” replied the other; “but the bullet is not
yet run that will take my life.”</p>

<p>“If I were to call out your name from that door, a long
rope and a short shrift would save the bullet the trouble,”
said Murdock.</p>

<p>The stranger winced at the words.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed; I don’t mean to betray you,” continued
Murdock. “It was an astonishing thing that I alone should
penetrate your disguise and guess who you were. I never
saw you but once before, either, and that was years ago. But
now to business. As I said before, I need your aid, and I am
willing to pay you well for it.”</p>

<p>“What is it you want me to do?”</p>

<p>“There’s a girl in the settlement that has rejected my advances.
I don’t care so much for her, but she’s the heiress to
a large fortune. Now, if the girl marries me, of course I get
the fortune, or if she dies, I get the fortune, for I am the next
heir. Now, I don’t want to take the life of the girl if I can
help it. I had much rather marry her; but, unfortunately,
she has taken a fancy to some one else, and won’t listen to
my suit. Now, my plan is to carry the girl off. I know a
lonely cabin, now deserted, some ten miles from the station,
on the other bank of the Kanawha. I want the girl carried
there, and the impression given to her that she is a prisoner
in the hands of the Indians. Then I’ll pretend to follow on
the trail—gain access to the cabin; offer to assist her to escape,
if in reward she’ll marry me. Of course she’ll feel
grateful for the risk I run for her sake, and consent. Then
I’ll escape with her, take her back to the settlement, and the
thing is done.”</p>

<p>“But suppose she refuses to marry you?”</p>

<p>“Then she won’t escape from the hands of the red-skins,
but they’ll kill her,” said Murdock, coolly.</p>

<p>“And in that case, you’ll come in for the property?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“The plan ought to work,” said Benton, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how it can fail. I want your assistance, and
I’ve got a fellow in the station that will help me. You two
will be enough to play Indian. It won’t be much trouble and
very little risk, and I’ll pay well for it.”</p>

<p>“When do you want it done?” asked the stranger.</p>

<p>“The sooner the better,” replied Murdock. “I suppose
that will suit you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, for I’ll soon have other fish to fry along the border,”
said the other, and a demon light gleamed from his fierce
eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you expect to drive the whites from the Ohio?” asked
Murdock.</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll raise such a blaze along the river, and strike
such a blow that it shall be felt, even to Virginia!” cried the
other, in a tone of fierce menace.</p>

<p>“It will be a bloody time,” said Murdock, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, blood will run like water,” replied the stranger.
“But what is the name of the girl that is to be carried off?”</p>

<p>“Virginia Treveling.”</p>

<p>The stranger started as though he had trodden upon a
snake.</p>

<p>“What, the daughter of General Treveling?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Murdock, wondering at the look of fierce
delight that swept over the face of the other.</p>

<p>“Satan’s fires!” cried the other, in triumph. “I’ll do the
job for you. I owe the father a bitter grudge. I struck him
one blow, some twelve years ago, just after he wronged me.
I doubt if he’s forgotten or forgiven it to this day. It’s about
time for me to strike him another.”</p>

<p>“Why, how did General Treveling ever wrong you?” asked
Murdock, in wonder.</p>

<p>“I was a scout under him in Dunmore’s campaign. One
day he told me openly, and before a dozen others, that I lied.
I gave the lie back in his teeth, for I never took insult from
mortal man. Then he struck me. I didn’t think even for a
moment that he was my superior officer; all that I knew was
that I was struck—degraded by a blow. I measured him
with my eye and felled him to my feet with a single stroke.
Then I was seized—tried by a drumhead court-martial, and
sentenced to be publicly whipped in presence of the whole
army, and I <em>was</em> whipped, too. As the lashes fell upon my
naked back, and cut long, quivering lines in the yielding flesh,
with every lash I swore a bitter oath of vengeance. Then,
my punishment done—a whipped, degraded slave, a man no
longer—they untied me. I sunk down at their feet almost
helpless. They raised me up; I was covered with my own
gore. This General Treveling—then only a colonel—looked
on me, his victim, with a scornful smile—ten thousand curses
on him! I was maddened with rage. I shook my fist defiantly
in his face, and before all I said: ‘Your quarters shall
swim in blood for this!’ I kept my word. I have shed white
blood enough along the Ohio for me to swim in. My vengeance,
too, against this man was fearful. I stole his eldest
child—left it to die in the forest. I tore his heart as his lashes
had torn my back. And now, I strike him a second time.”</p>

<p>Murdock gazed at the rage-inflamed countenance of the
dark-skinned man with a feeling akin to awe.</p>

<p>“It is a bargain, then, between us?” the young man said.</p>

<p>“Yes; to get another chance at him, I’d go through the
fires of Hades!” the other replied.</p>

<p>And so the compact was made.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">BOONE IN A TIGHT PLACE.</span></h2>


<p>Earnestly and with anxious faces the settlers discussed
the chances of the coming war.</p>

<p>With one voice Colonel Boone was selected as the commander
of the station.</p>

<p>Messengers were dispatched to warn the neighboring settlements.</p>

<p>Then Boone, taking Kenton and Lark aside, suggested that
they should make a scout into the Shawnee country and discover,
if possible, against which settlement the Indian attack
would be directed.</p>

<p>The suggestion suited well with the bold and daring spirit
of the border, and both Kenton and Lark gladly expressed
their willingness to accompany the skillful and daring woodman.</p>

<p>Boone gave Jackson a hint as to his intention, and then
the three left the settlement and entered the forest, heading
toward the Ohio.</p>

<p>Reaching the river, Lark drew from a little tangled thicket
near the river’s bank a canoe. He had previously hidden it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
there when he had crossed the Ohio on his way from the
Shawnee country to Point Pleasant.</p>

<p>By means of the canoe the three crossed the river. On the
northern bank they concealed the canoe in the thicket, and
then, striking to the north-west toward the Scioto river, they
plunged into the wilderness and took the trail leading to the
villages of the Shawnee nation.</p>

<p>On through the tangled thickets went the three rangers,
all their senses on the alert to discover traces of the hostile
red-skins.</p>

<p>After many a weary hour’s march, the three came near to
the village of Ke-ne-ha-ha.</p>

<p>Then they proceeded with increased caution. As yet they
had not seen a single trace that denoted the presence of the
Shawnees.</p>

<p>The scouts were now within some two miles of Chillicothe,
where Ke-ne-ha-ha’s village was located.</p>

<p>Then Boone called a halt.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” said the leader, “we are nigh to the red
devils, an’ we must be careful or we’ll stumble upon some of
’em afore we knows it. I think our best plan is to find some
hiding place to serve for a head-quarters, and then, separately,
after dark, we’ll scout into the village, an’ maybe we’ll
be able to discover some of the plans of the red varmints.”</p>

<p>“I know just the place for us,” said Lark. “We’re nigh
to it, too.”</p>

<p>Then Lark piloted the way through the forest—the three
had been standing by the bank of the Scioto—and at last
halted by a huge oak tree, at the base of which grew a tangled
mass of bushes.</p>

<p>“Hyer’s the spot,” said Lark, pointing to the tree.</p>

<p>“Whar?” asked Boone, who could not perceive any hiding-place
except it was in the branches of the oak.</p>

<p>“Hyer.”</p>

<p>Then Lark parted the tangled bushes with his hand.
Boone and Kenton saw that the trunk of the oak was hollow.
It contained a cavity, fully large enough to afford a <a id="Ref_9"></a>secret
refuge to the three, and the bushes closing behind them after
they had entered the hollow oak completely concealed them
from sight.</p>

<p>“This hyer is an old hidin’-place o’ mine,” said Lark, as
they stood within the hollow. “I diskivered it one day when
I shot a b’ar nigh hyer. The b’ar made for this bit of bush.
He had his den in this very tree-trunk. I followed him up an’
that’s the way I diskivered it.”</p>

<p>The shade of night was now fast descending upon the
earth, and darkness was vailing in the forest and river with
its inky mantle.</p>

<p>“Now, we’ll scout into the village,” said Boone; “we’ll
meet hyer ag’in in the morning—that is, if the savages don’t
captivate us.”</p>

<p>“Agreed,” responded the two others, and then all three left
the hollow oak.</p>

<p>With a silent pressure of the hand they separated, each one
picking out a path for himself, but all tending in the direction
of the village of Ke-ne-ha-ha.</p>

<p>The three hunters had been gone some ten or fifteen minutes
when a dark form stood by the oak.</p>

<p>He plunged his eyes carefully into the darkness that surrounded
him, as if fearful of being watched.</p>

<p>At last, apparently satisfied that no human eye looked upon
his movements, carefully and cautiously he separated the
bushes in front of the oak, and entered the hollow space within
the tree. The bushes closed with scarce a rustle behind him.</p>

<p>The insects of the night who had been disturbed and awed
to silence by the tread of the light foot, that prowled so cautiously
along the dim aisles of the forest, began again their
nocturnal cries.</p>

<p>The tree-toads cried, and the crickets chirruped. The air
seemed full of life. The owl—the minion of the night—came
forth from his perch in the tree-trunk. The young moon, too,
rising, cast its silver sheen over the forest.</p>

<p>Then again, suddenly, the voices of the night sunk into silence,
for, forth from the hollow of the oak, that the three
daring scouts had selected for their rendezvous, came the dark
figure that but a few minutes before with stealthy steps had
stolen beneath the leafy branches. It was evident that the
secret of the hollow tree was known to another than the
scouts.</p>

<p>Cautiously through the forest stole the dark form. The
tree-toad hushed its cries; the cricket noiselessly crept to his
hole; the owl peered forth from its cavity in the tree-trunk,
and then with its great eyes shining with fear, shrunk back
within the darkness of its lair, when it caught sight of the
dark form that so silently glided amid the trees.</p>

<p>On went the dark form through the forest. All living
things seemed to shrink from it in horror.</p>

<p>The moonbeams, slanting down and tinging the green of
the forest top with rays of silvery light, fell upon the figure
as it glided through a little opening in the woods.</p>

<p>The moonbeams defined the figure of a huge gray wolf, who
walked erect like a man, and who had the face of a human.
The dark form held in its paw an Indian tomahawk.</p>

<p>The moonbeams were gleaming upon the Wolf Demon, the
terrible scourge of the Shawnee tribe.</p>

<p>On through the forest went the hideous form, almost following
in the footsteps of the scout, Kenton, who had little
idea of the terrible creature that lurked behind him.</p>

<p>Boone had selected the bank of the river as his pathway to
the village of the Indians.</p>

<p>Carefully the ranger proceeded onward.</p>

<p>As he approached near to the Shawnee village, he could
hear the sound of the Indian drums and the war-cries of the
warriors.</p>

<p>From the sounds Boone easily guessed that the Indians
were preparing for the war-path.</p>

<p>Boone reached the edge of the timber. Before him lay the
village of his deadly foes.</p>

<p>A huge fire was burning before the council-lodge in the
center of the village, and the warriors were dancing around it.</p>

<p>“Look at the red devils!” muttered Boone, who from the
convenient shelter afforded by a fallen tree, just on the edge
of the timber, could easily watch the scene before him.
“They’re pantin’ to redden their knives in the blood of the
whites.”</p>

<p>Then the scout counted the Indians who were dancing
around the fire, and the others who were either watching the
scalp-dance, or lounging leisurely around the village. The
number of the red-men astonished the borderer.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem!” he muttered, “thar’s a tarnal heap of them.
I judge they’ll take the war-path soon.”</p>

<p>Then a squaw, with a gourd in her hand, evidently going to
the river for water, left the village and came directly toward
the spot where Boone was concealed.</p>

<p>The alarm of the hunter was great.</p>

<p>“Dod rot the luck!” he muttered, in disgust, “why on
yearth don’t she go straight to the drink, cuss her! She’ll
come plumb down on me if she keeps on, an’ then she’ll
raise the village with her squalls.”</p>

<p>The squaw, who was quite a young girl, and very handsome,
came directly on toward the ambush of the spy.</p>

<p>Then Boone saw that she was followed by one of the Indian
braves.</p>

<p>The great hunter began to feel extremely nervous. In
truth, unless the squaw changed her course, his position was
one of real peril.</p>

<p>“They’ll lift my ha’r if that blamed squaw diskivers me,
sure,” he muttered, in consternation.</p>

<p>The girl paused for a moment.</p>

<p>The heart of the hunter beat quick with hope.</p>

<p>“Now go to the river, you durned red-skin,” he said. It
is hardly necessary to remark that the observation was not
intended to reach the ears of the girl.</p>

<p>But the squaw hadn’t any intention of going to the river.
The gourd carried in her hand was simply an excuse to leave
her wigwam.</p>

<p>When the girl found that the young brave—whom in reality
she had stolen forth to meet—was following her, she
continued on her course, which led directly to the fallen tree,
behind which Boone was concealed.</p>

<p>“Oh, cuss the luck!” he muttered, in despair. “I wish she
was at the bottom of the Scioto. If she diskivers me thar’ll
be a row. I’m in for it like a treed coon.”</p>

<p>The girl, now satisfied that her lover had seen her leave the
wigwam, and conscious that he understood her motive, approached
the tree and sat down upon the trunk.</p>

<p>The young brave carelessly, so as not to excite the attention
of the other Indians, if any of them had chanced to see
him, strolled toward the thicket. Reaching it, concealed by
the shadow cast by the forest line, he took a seat upon the
fallen tree by the side of the squaw.</p>

<p>Boone hardly dared to breathe, lest he should betray his
presence to the twain. The scout was in a trap from which
he saw no escape.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">LOVE AND HATE.</span></h2>


<p>Harvey Winthrop had been the guest of the old General
some three days, and during those three days he had discovered
that he loved the fair girl, Virginia, whose life he had
saved, and he had reason to believe from her manner toward
him that she was not indifferent to that love.</p>

<p>Our hero determined to learn the truth. He was not one
of those who believed that it needed years to foster and ripen
love. Within his heart he felt that he loved Virginia with
a pure and holy passion. He was sure that he could not
have loved her any better if he had known her all his life.</p>

<p>Virginia guessed that she was loved by the young man—what
girl does not guess when she is loved?—and, perhaps,
willing to give him a chance to declare that love, she suggested
an excursion to the ravine where she had been rescued
from the bear by him.</p>

<p>Gladly Winthrop announced his willingness to accompany
her.</p>

<p>So the two set out for the ravine.</p>

<p>They passed down through the station and took the trail
leading up the Kanawha.</p>

<p>As they walked onward, chatting gayly together, they had
no suspicion that they were closely followed by three men,
who, holding a consultation together on the edge of the timber,
had noticed them as they passed.</p>

<p>Leaving the trail, the girl and the young man walked into
the ravine.</p>

<p>The three men, who had followed him so closely, paused
at the entrance to the gorge, apparently to consult together.</p>

<p>“The fellow is her lover, as I guessed,” said the foremost
of the three, the one who had been the most eager to follow
the two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“It looks like it,” said the taller of the two others, who was
the dark skinned stranger, who had called himself Benton.
The third one of the party was a worthless fellow who hung
about the station, ready to drink “corn-juice” when he
could get it, and fit for but little else. He was known as Bob
Tierson.</p>

<p>“I’d gi’n him a load of buckshot ef he came arter my gal!”
said Bob, who was somewhat given to boasting.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may,” replied Murdock, who was the leader of
the party. He spoke with an angry voice, and a lowering
cloud was upon his sallow face.</p>

<p>“If the young fellow was out of the way, this would be a
good opportunity to try the Indian game,” said Benton,
suggestively.</p>

<p>“Ef it was me, I’d put him out of the way mighty doggoned
quick!” exclaimed Bob, who seldom lost an opportunity
of telling what he would do.</p>

<p>“For the first time in your life, Bob, you’ve said a wise
thing,” said Murdock.</p>

<p>“Fur the first time!” cried Bob, in indignation. “Wal, I
reckon now, I don’t take a back seat to any man in the station—”</p>

<p>“In drinking whisky? No, you don’t, to do you justice,”
said Murdock, sarcastically. “But, Benton, can you fix up
for the Indian now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, easily enough,” replied the one addressed. “I’ve got
the pigment to paint our faces with in my pouch. Just lend
me your hunting-shirt, and take my coat.”</p>

<p>“How about your hair?”</p>

<p>“Tie a handkerchief over it, nigger-fashion,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, that will do,” said Murdock. “The girl will be so
frightened that she won’t be apt to notice you much. Tie a
handkerchief over her eyes the moment you grab her.”</p>

<p>“And the young feller?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Leave him to me,” and Murdock tapped the butt of his
rifle significantly.</p>

<p>“And you’ll leave him to the wolves, eh?” said Bob, with
a grin.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” replied Murdock, dryly.</p>

<p>“But the report of the rifle—if it should be heard at the
station—”</p>

<p>“A hunter after game, that’s all,” said Murdock. “But
come, let’s tree our game; I’ve an idea that there’ll be a love-scene
between the two up the ravine, and I’d like to be a
looker on.” Murdock ground his teeth at the very thought.</p>

<p>So, cautiously and slowly, the three left the little trail by
the banks of the Kanawha, and followed in the footsteps of
Virginia and Winthrop up the ravine.</p>

<p>The girl and the young man reached the spot where the encounter
with the bear had taken place, and there they
halted.</p>

<p>The quick eye of the girl caught sight of the drops of blood
dried upon the rock, where the bear had fallen and died.</p>

<p>“See,” she said, pointing to the spots upon the rock; “but
for you my blood would have stained the stone instead of the
brute’s.”</p>

<p>“And but for that strange girl who came so aptly to my
rescue, my blood might have been there, too,” said Winthrop.</p>

<p>“It was a moment of terrible peril,” and Virginia half-shuddered
at the bare remembrance.</p>

<p>“Yes; but it was evidently not your fate to die by the
claws and teeth of the bear.”</p>

<p>“What will my fate be?” said the girl, reflectively.</p>

<p>“A bright and happy one, I hope,” replied Winthrop. “I
am sure that you deserve none other.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the girl; “but we do not get our deservings
in this world.” As she spoke she sat down upon a rock that
cropped out of the ground, and looked up into the face of the
young man with her clear, bright eyes. In his heart Winthrop
thought that he had never seen such clear, innocent
eyes before.</p>

<p>“You should get yours,” replied Winthrop, “or else there
isn’t any justice in this world.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Virginia, half-sadly.</p>

<p>“How beautiful the forest is!” said the young man, glancing
around him; but in his heart he thought the fair girl at
his side was far more beautiful than any of her surroundings.</p>

<p>“How do you like our home by the banks of the Ohio?”
asked Virginia.</p>

<p>“So well that I think the rest of my life will be spent in
yonder settlement,” replied Winthrop, quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad of that!” The tone of the girl showed
that the words came directly from her heart. A warm flush
came over the face of the young man as the words fell upon
his ears.</p>

<p>“I am so glad to hear you say that!” The earnest tone of
Winthrop told the girl that her suspicion was truth. She was
loved.</p>

<p>“You are?” murmured Virginia, in a low tone. She felt
that the words that she wished to hear—for she loved the
man that had risked his life so nobly—would soon be spoken.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am! can you guess why?” The voice of Winthrop
trembled as he spoke.</p>

<p>Virginia glanced up shyly in the face of the young man,
then dropped her eyes to the earth again. She did not answer.</p>

<p>Encouraged by her silence, Winthrop spoke:</p>

<p>“Virginia, I have known you but a few days, but I feel
as if I had known you all my life. I have never met any one
in the world that I have liked as I do you—that I love as I
do you; for, Virginia, I love you with all my whole heart.”</p>

<p>Virginia hung her head; her glances shyly swept the ground.
She did not reply.</p>

<p>“You are not offended at my words, Virginia?” he said,
earnestly.</p>

<p>“No—no,” she replied, slowly, looking up in his face with
a half-smile.</p>

<p>Winthrop guessed the truth in the soft eyes that looked so
lovingly into his own.</p>

<p>“Virginia, may I hope that some day you will learn to
love me?” Winthrop asked, with eager hope patent in his
voice.</p>

<p>Virginia Treveling was a truthful woman, and so she answered
truthfully:</p>

<p>“No, not learn to love you, Harvey, for I <em>do</em> love you already!”</p>

<p>A moment more, and the head of the fair young girl was
pillowed on the manly bosom of her lover.</p>

<p>Oh! the flood of joy that came over the young man when
he discovered that the love that he wished so to gain was all
his own. That the heart now beating so fondly against his
breast was devoted to him, and to him alone.</p>

<p>“Virginia, do you love me, then?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she murmured, softly.</p>

<p>“You will be my wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You will be mine, then, forever and forever?”</p>

<p>The young man gently raised the little head that nestled
so snugly on his breast. Virginia understood the movement,
and anticipated the wish of her lover. With a shy smile
upon her face, and a coy look in her dark-brown eyes, she
gave her lips up to her lover’s caress.</p>

<p>The lips of the lovers met in a long, lingering kiss—the
first proof of love, so dear to all hearts. Lip to lip and soul
to soul.</p>

<p>Virginia Treveling gave herself to Harvey Winthrop.</p>

<p>A moment only the lovers remained in each other’s arms.</p>

<p>Then the sharp crack of a rifle broke the stillness of the
summer air.</p>

<p>With a groan of anguish Winthrop reeled from the fond
embrace of the young girl. He clutched wildly at the air,
and then fell heavily on his side upon the rocky surface.</p>

<p>With a shriek of terror Virginia knelt by the side of her
lover.</p>

<p>The shriek of the young girl was answered by the shrill
war-whoop of the Indian.</p>

<p>Forth from their covert in the thicket sprung two painted
braves, and rushed with eager haste toward the young girl.</p>

<p>Virginia did not try to fly. Her senses were chilled to
numbness by the fall of the man who but a moment before
had pressed the warm love-kiss upon her willing lips.</p>

<p>Eagerly the two that came from the thicket seized the girl.
With a moan of anguish she fell fainting into their arms.</p>

<p>The bird was in the net.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE CABIN IN THE FOREST.</span></h2>


<p>One of the white red-skins—for the two who had seized Virginia
were the dark-skinned stranger, Benton, and the tool of
Murdock, Bob Tierson, painted and disguised as Indians—tied
a handkerchief tightly over the eyes of the senseless girl, completely
blindfolding her.</p>

<p>When this had been accomplished, Murdock came from his
covert in the bushes, and approached the two.</p>

<p>The blackened muzzle of Murdock’s rifle told plainly that
it was he who had fired the shot which had stricken the
young stranger, Harvey Winthrop, to the earth, even while
the kisses of the girl he loved were fresh upon his lips.</p>

<p>“The girl has fainted,” said Benton, who supported the
light form of the hapless Virginia in his arms.</p>

<p>“So much the better!” exclaimed Murdock; “it aids our
purpose. We must convey her at once to the lonely cabin of
the Kanawha.”</p>

<p>“And this critter?” said Bob, kicking the motionless form
of Winthrop with his foot, carelessly, as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” asked Murdock.</p>

<p>Bob knelt down by the side of the young man.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s gone dead,” replied the borderer, after a slight
examination.</p>

<p>“I did not think it likely that he lived,” said Murdock,
with a grim smile. “I seldom have to fire twice.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve settled him, for sure,” observed Bob, with
a grin.</p>

<p>“Leave him alone, then; the crows and wolves will finish
him before the morrow,” said Murdock.</p>

<p>“He ought to have known better than to fool round this
piece of calico,” observed Bob, with another grin.</p>

<p>“He won’t be apt to do it again.”</p>

<p>“No, dog my cats if he will!” cried Bob, expressively.</p>

<p>“Can you carry the girl, Benton?” asked Murdock.</p>

<p>“Yes, easily,” replied the one addressed, raising the motionless
form of the young girl in his arms, apparently without
an effort.</p>

<p>“Let us be going, then. If we can reach the cabin before
she recovers, so much the better for my plan.”</p>

<p>Murdock led the way, followed closely by Benton carrying
the girl while Bob brought up the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Swiftly through the forest they went.</p>

<p>A half-hour’s march up the Kanawha and Murdock halted
by the bank of the river. Drawing a dug-out from its concealment
in some bushes that overhung the water, by its aid
the party crossed the river.</p>

<p>On the other bank of the stream, they again plunged into
the forest—first, however, carefully concealing the dug-out in
a similar hiding-place to that in which they found it.</p>

<p>After a three hours’ tramp through the thicket, they came
to a little log-cabin in the center of a little clearing. The
cabin bore the marks of decay, and the long grass that grew
thick over the threshold told that the builder had long since
abandoned the dwelling.</p>

<p>Virginia had recovered from her faint some time before the
party had reached the solitary cabin.</p>

<p>Terrible indeed were the feelings of the young girl. A
prisoner in the hands of the merciless red-men—for she had
no suspicions that her captors were white—she shrunk from
the thought of what her fate would be. Then, too, when she
remembered that she had seen her lover fall before her eyes,
perhaps mortally wounded, she felt as if her heart would
break.</p>

<p>The two disguised men placed the girl in the cabin; then
Bob left Benton alone with the maid. Murdock was afraid
that Virginia might recognize the borderer in spite of his
disguise; but as Benton was a stranger there was but little
danger that the girl would suspect her captors to be of her
own race and blood.</p>

<p>Benton removed the bandage from the eyes of the girl.</p>

<p>“Squaw—prisoner to Shawnee,” said the disguised white,
imitating the manner and speech of the red-skin. “No try
to run or warrior take scalp.”</p>

<p>Then Benton joined the other two on the outside of the
cabin, closing the door carefully behind him.</p>

<p>“Well, the game is treed,” said Bob, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Murdock, a grim smile of satisfaction upon
his sallow face. “Now you two keep watch here and be
sure that the girl does not escape. I will return to the station.
Her absence will be discovered before long and search
will probably be made. If they discover the body of the
stranger, this Winthrop, in the ravine, which they will be
sure to do if any saw them leave the settlement together,
which is probable, it will lead all to suspect that the man
was murdered by some strolling red-skins and the girl carried
off by them.”</p>

<p>“But may they not trace us?” asked Benton, shrewdly.
“There are keen scouts in the station. If they once strike
our trail, they’ll be apt to run us to earth.”</p>

<p>“There is little danger in that,” replied Murdock. “After
we left the ravine we struck the regular trail leading up
the river. There are many fresh footprints on the trail; it
will be difficult for even the best Indian scout on the border
to pick out the marks left by us from the others. Besides,
crossing the river would be apt to throw the keenest trailer
off the scent. I do not think that any one will discover or
even suspect our agency in the girl’s disappearance.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t likely,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>“No, I think that you are right, and that you will succeed
in your plan regarding the girl,” said Benton. There was a
strange sound in the voice of the man as he uttered the simple
sentence, and a peculiar expression in his dark, snake-like
eyes. Murdock did not notice the strangeness of the
tone nor the look.</p>

<p>“I can not fail,” said Murdock, decidedly. “You will
need food for the girl. Here in the hollow of this tree,” and
Murdock led the way to a small white oak, some dozen paces
from where they stood, “is some dried deer-meat. I think I
shall rescue the girl to-morrow,” and Murdock laughed
slightly, at the idea, as he spoke. “There is a small hole
under the logs in the back of the cabin, by which I can creep
inside and appear to the girl in my new character of a saving
angel, periling all to rescue her from the hands of the
red-skins.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but may she not discover this hole and escape through
it?” asked Benton.</p>

<p>“No, a heavy log on the outside, that can not be stirred
from the inside of the cabin, prevents that.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, then, you’ll return?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Then Murdock left the twain to watch the cabin and the
prisoner, and plunging into the forest took his way back to
Point Pleasant. And in his heart, as he walked along, he
gloated over the success of the plan that had struck a hated
rival from his path and given entirely into his power the girl
whose fortune he craved.</p>

<p>We will now return to the little ravine wherein, stark and
ghastly, lay the form of the young stranger, Harvey Winthrop;
the man who had left home and friends to carve out
a future by the banks of the Ohio, and who had fallen by the
ball of the assassin, without even a chance to struggle for his
life.</p>

<p>The little ravine looked bright and beautiful; the rays of
the fast-dying sun glinted down, gayly, through the tree-tops,
and played in beams of lambent light upon the pale face,
whose open eyes glared, as if in mockery, on all around.</p>

<p>The rocky glade was as fair to look upon with the dreadful
evidence of man’s crime lying in its center, as when,
but a short hour before, its leafy branches had formed a living
frame to a picture of true love.</p>

<p>A huge black crow flying high and lazily in the air caught
sight of the white face that so steadily stared with its stony
and fixed eyes at the sky.</p>

<p>The bird of evil omen swooped round in circling flight
above the motionless figure.</p>

<p>Each circle was smaller than the previous one, each second
brought the bird nearer to its destined prey.</p>

<p>Still stared the eyes upward—still on the white face played
the flickering sunbeams.</p>

<p>With a downward swoop, the carrion-bird alighted on the
breast of the stricken man.</p>

<p>The blood that stained the hunting-shirt of the silent figure
crimsoned the talons of the disgusting bird.</p>

<p>With a hoarse note the crow flapped its sable wings as if
in gloating triumph over the coming feast.</p>

<p>One short minute more and the great eyes would stare no
more at the sky above. The beak of the carrion crow would
be scarlet with human gore.</p>

<p>But, ere ten seconds of that minute passed away, a slight
rustle came from the tangled thicket that fringed the ravine.
The crow, with a hoarse note of anger, spread its wings
and, cheated of its prey—cheated of the great eyes and the
banquet of blood—soared lazily upward.</p>

<p>Then from the thicket, with stealthy tread, came a gaunt
wolf.</p>

<p>A moment later the beast stood upon the edge of the ravine.
Then it scented the blood that had trickled from the breast
of the man who lay motionless upon the rocks.</p>

<p>With noiseless steps the gaunt beast came onward. It
halted by the side of the motionless figure.</p>

<p>The fierce eyes of the wolf peered into the face of the human,
and the huge jaws opened and shut with an ominous
clash.</p>

<p>Then from the tree-top the carrion bird stooped again to
earth.</p>

<p>Alarmed for a moment by the flap of the wings, the wolf
lifted its huge jowl and displayed its white tusks in anger.
The prowling beast was willing to fight for the human banquet.</p>

<p>But the carrion crow and the huge gray wolf were comrades
of old in the great greenwood, and many a banquet had
they shared together.</p>

<p>The crow opened its beak and the wolf licked its jaws as
they stood by the side of the fallen man.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE SURPRISE.</span></h2>


<p>Boone, concealed in the bushes behind the fallen tree, on
which sat the Indian girl and the red warrior, cursed the unlucky
star that led the twain to select the place of his concealment
for a stolen interview.</p>

<p>The scout hardly dared to breathe lest he should betray his
presence to the two.</p>

<p>They, however, looking with eyes full of love upon each
other, thought only of the happiness that they enjoyed when
thus together.</p>

<p>The girl was the daughter of the great chief, Ke-ne-ha-ha;
her lover was a young brave known as the “White Dog.” A
warrior young in years, but who had already distinguished
himself on the war-path against the foes of the great Shawnee
nation.</p>

<p>The children of the wilderness, wrapped in the joy of the
stolen meeting, had little thought of aught else, and never for
a moment suspected that within arm’s length, a listener to
their conversation, lay the great ranger and scout, Daniel
Boone—the man whose death-dealing rifle was destined to tumble
many a plumed and painted warrior to the earth.</p>

<p>The scout, who fully realized the danger of his position, could
see no possible way to escape. He knew full well that the
slightest movement on his part would inevitably betray his
presence to the two who sat on the trunk of the fallen tree.
Once discovered, every warrior in the Shawnee village would
be quick on his trail.</p>

<p>One thought only consoled Boone. From the conversation
of the squaw and chief—Boone understood enough of the
Shawnee tongue to comprehend what was said—he might
learn something concerning the Indian expedition. If he
could gain important information, and manage to escape without
betraying his presence to the Indians, then his mission
would be accomplished.</p>

<p>“Is the chief satisfied?” asked the girl, with a smile, gazing
full into the dark eyes of her lover as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the warrior. “Le-a-pah has kept her word.
She is the singing-bird of the Shawnee nation. The White
Dog will love her till the great lamp in the sky grows old and
the spirit-lights fade and die forever.”</p>

<p>“Le-a-pah is the daughter of a great chief; he would be angry
if he knew that his child met the young brave by the forest,”
said the girl, sadly.</p>

<p>“The White Dog is a young warrior, but the scalps of the
Delaware already hang and dry in the smoke of his wigwam.”
The tone of the young chief was proud as he uttered the words
that told of his prowess.</p>

<p>“The chief speaks with a straight tongue,” and the girl
looked with pride into the manly face of her lover. “Le-a-pah
loves the White Dog, but the great chief, her father, has said
that she must be the wife of the warrior who is called Black
Cloud. The heart of Le-a-pah is sad, for she can not love
the Black Cloud.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Black Cloud is old—the singing-bird is young. Would
her father mate the bounding spring with the chill autumn?
It is bad!” and the young brave shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“The Black Cloud is a great chief,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“When the White Dog comes back from the war-path
against the white-skins on the Ohio, <em>he</em> will be a great chief,
too. Many white scalps will hang at his belt, and his tomahawk
will be red with the blood of the long-rifles,” said the
chief, proudly.</p>

<p>Boone, from his hiding-place, listened intently when the
warrior spoke of the expedition to Ohio. This was the very
information he was after.</p>

<p>“The white-skins are many; the Shawnee chief may fall
by their hands,” and a shadow of apprehension passed across
the face of the Indian maiden as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Then his spirit will go to the long home beyond the skies,
and in the spirit-land will chase the red deer. But, if the
White Dog comes back to the banks of the Scioto, then Le-a-pah
must be his wife and dwell forevermore in his wigwam.”</p>

<p>“The Shawnee girl will be the wife of the young chief
whom she loves as the sun loves the earth, or she will never
sing in the wigwam of a chief.”</p>

<p>“Good!”</p>

<p>The young brave drew the slight form of the unresisting
girl to his heart.</p>

<p>“The chief will love the singing-bird while he lives; when
he dies, her face will be in his heart,” said the warrior,
fondly.</p>

<p>“When does the chief go on the war-path?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>“Three sleeps more and the Shawnees will burst like a
thunder-cloud on the pale-faces,” replied the Indian.</p>

<p>“On the Ohio?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the chief.</p>

<p>“Now, if the heathen would only say whar,” muttered Boone,
listening eagerly.</p>

<p>“The white-skins will fight hard.” The girl was thinking
of the peril that her lover was about to encounter.</p>

<p>“The red-men will fight as they have never fought before,”
said the warrior. “The tomahawk and brand shall scourge
the pale-face from the ground that the Great Spirit gave to
the Indian. The waters of the Kanawha shall run red with
blood. The Shawnees have not forgotten the many braves
that fell by the deadly leaden hail of the white-skins many
moons ago, by the Ohio and Kanawha.”</p>

<p>The chief referred to the defeat sustained by the Indians at
the hands of the border-men commanded by Lewis, which
took place some years before the time of the action of our
story.</p>

<p>“It is against Point Pleasant, then,” said Boone, to himself,
as the words of the Indian fell upon his ear. “Well, let ’em
come! I reckon we can blaze ’em as bad the second time as
we did the first. Now, if these young critters would only
make tracks out o’ this, how quick I’d make a bee-line for
the Ohio. But—dog-gone their copper-colored hides!—they
don’t seem at all in a hurry to go.”</p>

<p>The scout was right in his thought. The two lovers were
in no hurry to bring their love-meeting to a close. It was
probably the last chance that they would have of being together,
and they were anxious to improve the opportunity.
Love is the same the world over, whether it springs in the
heart of the savage, beneath the spreading branches of the
oak in the forest wilderness, or in the breast of fashion’s votary
in the crowded city.</p>

<p>Warmly the warrior pressed his suit and told of the deathless
flame that burned within his heart. Coyly listened the
girl to the avowal that she loved to hear.</p>

<p>The lover eagerly pleaded for a farewell kiss from the lips
that he had ne’er touched. Shyly the Indian maid refused the
favor, though in her heart she consented.</p>

<p>The chief clasped the girl in his arms. She, with assumed
anger, freed herself from his embrace and pushed him away.
The chief, losing his balance in the struggle, tumbled over
backward from the log, coming down plump on top of the
scout concealed in the bushes behind the tree.</p>

<p>Quick from the throat of the Indian came the note of
alarm. He realized instantly that the form concealed in the
bushes must be the form of a foe.</p>

<p>With a mighty effort, Boone rolled the chief to one side,
then sprung to his feet, prepared to fly for his life.</p>

<p>The Indian girl shrieked with terror when she beheld a
pale-face spring up amid the bushes.</p>

<p>Her cry attracted the attention of the Indians in the village,
and, with hasty steps, they rushed toward the line of
timber, anxious to learn the cause of the alarm.</p>

<p>Boone felt that desperate effort alone would save him. A
foot-race through the forest with a score of Shawnees was
the only chance, but to escape the vengeance of the Indians
would require a fearful effort.</p>

<p>As the scout started, his foot caught in a clinging vine, and
over he went on his face. Before he could recover, the young
chief, the White Dog, was upon him.</p>

<p>The Indian was sinewy and stout of limb, yet he was no
match for the stalwart scout. With a grasp of steel, Boone
grappled with the red warrior.</p>

<p>For a moment they swayed to and fro over the earth; the
scout trying to break the grip of the Indian, and he striving
to hold the unknown foe until his brethren should come to
his aid.</p>

<p>The Shawnees were approaching fast. Their shouts rung
out on the air like a death-knell.</p>

<p>Thus nerved to redouble his exertions, the iron-limbed
scout swung the red-skin from the ground, and essayed to cast
him from him; but, like a snake, the supple savage twined
himself around the body of the white.</p>

<p>The cries of the Indian girl, alarmed for the safety of her
lover, were answered by the angry shouts of the approaching
crowd, who could plainly see that there was a struggle going
on in the borders of the thicket.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” cried the girl: “this way! a white-skin!”</p>

<p>“Let go your hold, you cussed red imp!” cried Boone,
between his teeth, as he vainly tried to break the grip of the
red chief.</p>

<p>The Indian now was merely trying to hold the white foe
till assistance should come to his aid.</p>

<p>Desperate, Boone’s hand sought the handle of his knife.
The bright blade flashed in the air; a second more, and it
would have been buried to the haft in the body of the White
Dog, but the Indian girl perceived her lover’s peril, and sprung
to his aid, grasping the hand of the scout just as he was about
to plunge the knife in the red-man’s breast.</p>

<p>The red chief, taking advantage of the girl’s aid, twisted
his leg around that of the scout, bore Boone backward to the
earth, upon which the combatants fell with a heavy shock.
A second more, and the Shawnee warriors surrounded the
contending men.</p>

<p>With many a cry of triumph they bound the daring pale-face
who had lurked so near to the Shawnee village.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">KENTON SEES THE WOLF DEMON.</span></h2>


<p>After having secured with tough thongs of deer-skin the
stalwart limbs of their prisoner, they bore him forward to
where the fire burned in their village.</p>

<p>All the inhabitants, attracted by the noise of the capture,
had left their lodges and now pressed forward to look upon
the prisoner.</p>

<p>Great was the astonishment of the Shawnees when the
flickering light of the flames, falling upon their captive, revealed
to them the well-known face of Daniel Boone, the great
scout of the border.</p>

<p>A howl of delight resounded through the Indian village at
this discovery. The red-skins had no foe whom they dreaded
more than the man they now held, bound and helpless, a prisoner
in their midst.</p>

<p>A grim smile was upon the features of Ke-ne-ha-ha, the
Shawnee chief, as he looked upon the face of the man who
had so often escaped him on the war-path.</p>

<p>“The white-skin is no longer an eagle, but a fox; he creeps
into the shadow of the Shawnee village, to use his ears,” said
the chief, mockingly.</p>

<p>“The Shawnees have already had proof that I can use my
hands,” replied the scout, nettled by the words as well as the
tone of the savage. “A chief that is not fox as well as eagle,
is not worthy to go upon the war-path. His scalp should be
taken by squaws.”</p>

<p>The Indians could not dispute the words of Boone.</p>

<p>“What seeks the white chief in the village of the Shawnees?”
asked Ke-ne-ha-ha.</p>

<p>“Guess, and maybe you’ll find out,” replied the captive
coolly.</p>

<p>“The white-skin comes as a spy—a foe into the village of
the Shawnee,” said the Indian.</p>

<p>“When did any of your nation, chief, ever come except as
a spy or a foe to the houses of the whites?” asked Boone.</p>

<p>“Ugh! the white-skin has stolen the land of the red-man.
Cheated him with lies. Ke-ne-ha-ha is a great warrior—he
will take the scalps of the long-knives and burn their wigwams,”
said the Indian, proudly.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to fight afore you accomplish <em>that</em>, Injun, I
reckon,” replied Boone, whose coolness and courage astonished
the red warriors.</p>

<p>“The white-skin shall die!” said the chief, fiercely.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’ve all got to die, sometime, Injun,” answered
Boone, not in the least terrified by the threat.</p>

<p>“Let my warriors take the prisoner to the wigwam of Ke-ne-ha-ha,”
said the chief.</p>

<p>The order was instantly obeyed. The prisoner was carried
to the wigwam—one of the largest in the village. In the center
of the lodge a little fire was burning.</p>

<p>The scout was laid upon a little couch of skins within the
lodge; then, in obedience to an order from the great chief,
the Indians withdrew and left the captive alone with Ke-ne-ha-ha.</p>

<p>The chief’s wigwam stood only a few paces from the banks
of the Scioto, that stream running close behind the Indian
lodge.</p>

<p>After the Indians had placed the helpless prisoner within
the lodge, they returned again to their scalp-dance around
the fire, excepting a few warriors, who, under the leadership
of the White Dog—who suddenly found himself famous by
his capture of the great scout—made a circuit of the forest
surrounding the Shawnee village to discover if there were
any more white foes lurking within the wood.</p>

<p>The search was fruitless. No trace could they find of the
presence of a white-skin; and so, finally, they came to the
conclusion that the daring ranger was alone. The Indians
then returned to the village.</p>

<p>The escape of Kenton from the search of the Indians is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
easily explained. He had approached the village on the west,
and, skillfully taking advantage of the cover afforded by the
bushes, had, like Boone, reached the edge of the timber.
From his position he commanded a view of the village, and
from his concealment beheld the capture of his friend. Guessing
shrewdly that the presence of one white man might lead
them to suspect that there were others in the neighborhood,
he determined to withdraw from his dangerous position. He
had seen no sign of Lark since he had parted with him at the
hollow oak, and he came to the conclusion that Lark had
not yet reached the village.</p>

<p>Kenton retreated from his exposed position. Slowly making
his way through the wood, his eyes fell upon a large oak tree.
The thought suggested itself to him that in the branches of
the oak, he might find shelter.</p>

<p>So up the tree he mounted.</p>

<p>Once more in his hiding-place, vailed in as he was by the
leafy branches, he felt that he could bid defiance to any search
that the Indians might make.</p>

<p>Hardly had Kenton adjusted himself comfortably in the tree,
when he heard a slight rustling in the bushes to the right of
the oak. The keen ear of the alert scout instantly knew that
some one was moving cautiously through the thicket. The
sound came from the direction of the village.</p>

<p>Kenton thought that, possibly, it was Lark, who, like himself,
had scouted into the Shawnee village, and was retreating
to safer quarters.</p>

<p>Then, through the dim aisles of the forest came a dark
form gliding onward with stealthy steps. In the uncertain
light Kenton thought he recognized the figure of Abe Lark,
the scout. Bending down from his hiding-place, Kenton was
about to warn him that a friend was near, when the dark
form crossed a little opening upon which the moonbeams cast
their rays of silvery light, and Kenton caught a glimpse of
the form as it glided through the moonlit opening.</p>

<p>The lion-hearted scout almost dropped from the tree when
his eyes fell upon that form. The hair upon his head rose in
absolute fright. His eyeballs were distended, and cold drops
of sweat stood like waxen beads upon his bronzed forehead.</p>

<p>Well might he feel a sense of terror, for there below him
glided—what?</p>

<p>The vast proportions of a huge gray wolf, walking erect
upon hind legs, but the wolf possessed the face of a human!</p>

<p>A moment only the wolf—man or phantom—whatever it
was—was beheld by the astonished scout, then it disappeared
in the gloom of the thicket.</p>

<p>With the back of his hand Kenton wiped the perspiration—cold
as the night-dew—from his brow.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen it!” he muttered, to himself. “It’s the Wolf
Demon. Jerusalem! I’d rather fight forty Shawnees than
have a tussle with a monster like that. I always thought
that the Injun story ’bout the Wolf Demon was all bosh, but
now I’ve seen it; so near the Shawnee village, too. Thar’ll
be a hurricane soon, or I’m a Dutchman.”</p>

<p>Leaving the scout to his meditations, we will follow the
course of the terrible figure that had so affrighted the stout
Simon Kenton, who was one of the bravest hearts on the
border.</p>

<p>Cautiously and carefully through the thicket the creature
glided. It was making its way to the Scioto river.</p>

<p>Suddenly the figure paused, and apparently listened for a
moment.</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps of the Indian warriors, headed by
the White Dog, scouting through the forest, broke the stillness
of the night.</p>

<p>But for a moment the mysterious Wolf Demon listened;
then as the Indians came nearer and nearer, with a leap, as
agile as that of the squirrel, the terrible form seized hold of
a branch of the oak beneath which it was standing, and
swung itself up into the concealment of the leaves of the
tree.</p>

<p>The Indian braves came on and paused for consultation
under the branches of the very tree that concealed, in its
leafy recesses, the terrible scourge of their race.</p>

<p>“Wah! The pale chief is alone,” said one of the warriors;
“no other pale-face is within the woods.”</p>

<p>“He is a brave chief to come alone to the lodges of the
Shawnee nation,” said another of the warriors.</p>

<p>“Boone is a great brave,” said the White Dog, who felt a
natural pride in extolling the bravery of the prisoner whose
capture was placed to his credit.</p>

<p>“He will never take the war-path against the Shawnees
again,” said one of the braves, with on accent of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“No; his scalp shall blacken and dry in the smoke of a
Shawnee’s lodge,” said the White Dog.</p>

<p>“It is good,” responded another, with a grunt of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“The great white-skin will die by the fire, and the red
braves will dance around him with joy,” said the Indian
who had first spoken, with a fierce expression of delight in
his voice.</p>

<p>“The long-knife was alone—no more are within the wood;
let us return to the village,” said the White Dog.</p>

<p>The other warriors grunted their assent, and the party,
turning upon their heel, took the way leading back to the
village.</p>

<p>Hardly had the figure of the rearmost savage disappeared
in the gloom of the wood, when forth from the tree came the
terrible figure.</p>

<p>Lightly it bounded to the ground, and, with a glittering
tomahawk clutched in its paw, followed swiftly but cautiously
on the track of the red-men.</p>

<p>The Indians, however, kept together. Had one remained
behind the other, he would never have lived to have told what
struck him.</p>

<p>The terrible form followed to the edge of the timber, and
ground its teeth in rage at the escape of its foe.</p>

<p>Then it headed again for the river, keeping within the shelter
of the timber. The river reached, the mysterious prowler
took advantage of the stream’s bank, which had been hollowed
out by the washing of the water, to reach the wigwam
of Ke-ne-ha-ha in which Boone was confined.</p>

<p>There, in the very shadow of the wigwam, the terrible
figure lay upon the ground concealed by the darkness, and
listened intently.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE OFFER OF THE SHAWNEE CHIEF.</span></h2>


<p>Boone and the chief of the Shawnees were alone together
in the Indian wigwam.</p>

<p>The white man wondered why the Indian had dismissed
his warriors. He guessed that the chief had probably something
to say to him privately, and which he did not wish the
others to hear; but of the nature of that communication he
could not form the least idea.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha surveyed the prisoner for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>The dim light of the fire illuminated the interior of the
wigwam, so that each could plainly distinguish the face of
the other.</p>

<p>At length the chief spoke.</p>

<p>“The pale-face is a great warrior in his nation—many red
chiefs have fallen by his hand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it was in fair fight, man to man,” replied the
scout.</p>

<p>“The squaws of the slain braves mourn their loss—they
call upon the chief of the Shawnees to give them the blood
of the white-skin who has stained his hand red with the
blood of the Shawnee. The tears of the widowed wives fall
thick upon the ground. The heart of Ke-ne-ha-ha is sad
when he thinks of the brave warriors that the pale-face has
sent to the happy hunting-grounds. Why should not the
Long Rifle die by the hand of the red-man?”</p>

<p>“What on yearth is the use of askin’ any such foolish
questions?” cried Boone, impatiently. “You know very
well that you’re going to put an end to me, if you can. As
for the blood that I’ve shed of your nation, I’ve always
struck in self-defense. If any of your warriors feel aggrieved,
I’m ready to meet ’em—even two to one—and give ’em all the
satisfaction that they want.”</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha looked at the white keenly as he uttered the
bold defiance.</p>

<p>“Ugh! When the hunters catch the bear they do not let
him go free again, nor do they let the Long Rifle go free now
that they have caught him. The red chiefs will punish the
warrior who has killed their brothers, without risking their
lives against him. The fire is burning now before the council-lodge
of the Shawnee. When it burns to-morrow the
white hunter will be in its center, and the angry flames shall
lap up his blood. The ashes of the Long Rifle alone shall
remain to tell of the vengeance of the red chiefs.” The Indian
still looked with searching eyes into the face of the
prisoner as he told of the manner of his death. But if the
Shawnee chief expected to see there the signs of fear, he
was disappointed, for the iron-like muscles of Boone’s face
never moved.</p>

<p>“Why in thunder do you want to tell a fellow that he’s
a-goin’ to be roasted?” asked Boone, coolly. “Won’t it be
time enough for me to find out when you tie me to the stake,
and I see the smoke a-rising around me?”</p>

<p>The Indian was evidently annoyed that his words had not
made more impression upon the scout.</p>

<p>“The white skin does not fear death, then?” the chief
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” answered Boone; “I fear it like thunder.
Just you let me loose once, and see how I’ll run from it.
Lightning will be a fool to my heels.”</p>

<p>The joking manner of the scout puzzled the red warrior.
He knitted his brows for a moment, as if in deep thought.
Then again he spoke.</p>

<p>“The white chief is a great warrior. What would he give
to escape the fire-death of the Shawnees?”</p>

<p>Boone couldn’t exactly understand the meaning of the
chief’s words, though the question that he asked seemed plain
enough.</p>

<p>“Well, chief,” Boone said, after pausing for a moment, as
if deliberating upon his answer, “life is sweet; a man would
give almost anything for life. But the question with me now
is, what can I give?”</p>

<p>“Yourself,” said the chief, laconically.</p>

<p>“Eh?” Boone could not understand</p>

<p>“The white chief is a great brave; he has put to death
many great chiefs. If he will become a son of the Shawnee
nation, the warriors will forget what he <em>has</em> done, and will
look forward to what he <em>will</em> do.”</p>

<p>Boone was considerably astonished at the words of the
chief, although this was not the first time in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
his eventful life that the Indians had endeavored to get him
to join with them.</p>

<p>“Become a Shawnee, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the chief.</p>

<p>“Then the Shawnees will not burn me?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But if I refuse?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow’s sun will rise upon your death.”</p>

<p>“If I become one of your tribe, what am I expected to
do?”</p>

<p>“Take the war-path with the Shawnee braves against the
white-skins,” answered the chief.</p>

<p>“That is, betray the men who speak my tongue—who are
my brothers—into the hands of your people?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the chief; “my brother speaks with a
straight tongue.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see you hanged first,” muttered Boone, indignantly,
to himself, but he was careful not to let the speech reach the
ears of the Indian. He fully understood the dangerous position
that fate had placed him in, and the thought flashed
through his mind that if he could deceive the savages by
pretending to accept their offer, he might delay his execution—gain
time, and possibly, through some lucky chance, contrive
to effect his escape.</p>

<p>Boone had been fully as near to death before, and yet escaped
to tell of it. He did not despair even now, though a
prisoner in the midst of the great Shawnee tribe.</p>

<p>“How long will you give me to think over this proposal
that you make me?” Boone asked. “You know a man can’t
change his country and his color as easily as to pull off a coat
and put on a hunting-shirt.”</p>

<p>The Indian thought for a moment over the question of the
scout. Bound securely as he was; surrounded, too, by the
Shawnee warriors, escape was impossible. There was little
danger in delaying the sentence of the white-skin.</p>

<p>“Will until to-morrow suit my brother?” asked the chief.</p>

<p>“To-morrow?” said Boone; then to his mind came the
thought that, before that morrow came, something might
transpire to aid him to escape. “Well, until to-morrow will
do, though it’s mighty short time for a man to make up his
mind on such a ticklish question as this is.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow then my brother will say whether he will become
a Shawnee or be burnt at the stake to appease the unquiet
souls of the brave warriors that his hand has sent to
the happy hunting-grounds?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Boone, “to-morrow you shall have my
answer.” But, even as he spoke, in his heart he prayed
that some lucky accident might aid him ere the night was
over.</p>

<p>“It is good,” replied the chief, gravely. “Let my brother
open his ears. The chief of the Shawnees would talk
more.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, chief,” said Boone, who wondered what was
coming next.</p>

<p>“My brother is a great warrior; he has fought the Shawnees
many times—fought also the Mingoes, the Delawares
and the Wyandots. Many a red chief has leveled his rifle
full at the heart of the white brave, but the bullet was turned
aside by the ‘medicine’ of my brother. Is the chief a medicine-man?”</p>

<p>Boone understood the superstition of the Indians. He
saw, too, that possibly he might use the belief of being invulnerable
against rifle-ball to aid him in his desperate strait.</p>

<p>“The chief will be silent if I speak?” Boone asked, mysteriously.</p>

<p>“The heart of Ke-ne-ha-ha is like the pools of the Scioto—cast
a stone into them, it sinks to the bottom and remains
there. So shall the words of my brother sink into my
heart.”</p>

<p>“I am a medicine-man.”</p>

<p>“And bullet can not harm my brother?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Boone, impressively; “not if I keep out of its
way,” he added, to himself.</p>

<p>The Indian looked at Boone for a moment in silence; a
slight expression of awe was in his face. Then the chief
came nearer to the old scout, and in a solemn tone, spoke:</p>

<p>“Has the white-skin ever heard of the Wolf Demon of the
Shawnees?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the scout, somewhat surprised at the
question.</p>

<p>“The Wolf Demon is the scourge of the Shawnee tribe.
Many brave warriors have fallen by the tomahawk of the
monster, and on their breasts he leaves his totem—a Red
Arrow. Ke-ne-ha-ha is the great chief of the Shawnee nation;
scalps hang thick in the smoke of his wigwam; he is
not afraid of man or demon. But the scourge of the Shawnees
fears to meet a warrior unless he is alone in the forest.
Ke-ne-ha-ha has sought for the Wolf Demon, but he can
not find him. The red chief would kill the monster that
uses the totem of the Red Arrow. If my brother is a
medicine-man, can he not tell me where I may find the Wolf
Demon?”</p>

<p>“I can not,” answered Boone.</p>

<p>The chief looked disappointed.</p>

<p>“The red-man is sorry. He will see his brother in the
morning.” Then the chief stalked, moodily, from the lodge.</p>

<p>For an hour or more Boone remained in silence. The fire
in the center of the lodge burnt out and darkness surrounded
the scout.</p>

<p>Then to the keen ear of the woodman came the sound of
a knife cutting through the skins that formed the walls of
the wigwam.</p>

<p>A few minutes more and Boone, despite the gloom of the
wigwam, could see that a dark form stood by his side.</p>

<p>The scout knew in an instant that it was a friend. He
thought it either Lark or Kenton that had so aptly come to
his assistance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.</span></h2>


<p>On the morning following the day on which the young
stranger, Harvey Winthrop, had been shot down in the little
ravine by the Kanawha river, and Virginia was carried off by
the villainous tools of Clement Murdock, to the lonely cabin
on the other bank of the stream to that on which the settlement
of Point Pleasant was located, Murdock again stood
before the cabin. The stranger, Benton, and the drunken
vagabond, Bob Tierson, had remained by the cabin, still wearing
their Indian disguises.</p>

<p>“How does the girl bear it?” Murdock asked, on joining
the others. The three stood within the wood just beyond the
little clearing.</p>

<p>“Oh, well enough,” answered Benton. “I took her in
some breakfast this morning. She’s been crying all night, I
reckon. I spoke Injun-fashion to her. She implored me to
take her back to the settlement and promised all sorts of rewards.”</p>

<p>“She’ll be quite ready then to look upon me in the light of
a deliverer, I suppose,” said Murdock, a smile lighting up his
sallow features.</p>

<p>“All you’ve got to do is to go in and win,” said Bob, with a
grin.</p>

<p>“That is just what I intend to do,” replied Murdock, enjoying
his triumph in anticipation.</p>

<p>“By the way, are they making any row in the settlement
over the girl’s disappearance?” asked Benton, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Yes, all the settlers have been scouring the forest since
last night when her absence was discovered,” answered Murdock.</p>

<p>“And her father—the old General—what does he say
about it?”</p>

<p>“He is nearly crazy over the disappearance of his daughter.
I nearly felt pity for the old man, but I consoled myself by
thinking how great his joy would be, when I brought his
daughter back to him, and how glad he would be to receive
as his son-in-law the man who, at the peril of his life, rescued
her from the murdering red-skins.”</p>

<p>Murdock smiled grimly as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Well, dog my cats if it ain’t as good as a show,” said Bob,
with a laugh all over his huge, ugly face at the idea. “I shall
have to be ’round to witness the interesting meeting.”</p>

<p>“Yes; you must make yourself scarce as soon as I take the
girl off, for you’ll have the whole country on your trail. Of
course I shall have to describe where I found her.”</p>

<p>“But, s’pose they do come arter us, how kin we kiver up
the trail?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, easy enough,” replied Murdock; “the moment you
strike the trail on the other bank of the Kanawha, who can
tell whether you go up or down? There’s too many fresh
marks on it for any one to be able to pick out ours.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any danger,” said Benton, calmly.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad of that, for I don’t like any more danger
than I’ve got to scratch through,” observed Bob, and to do him
justice he spoke the truth. Bob’s reputation for bravery was
not particularly good among the settlers of Point Pleasant.</p>

<p>“Did they discover the body of the young man that you
knocked over with your rifle?” asked Benton.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Murdock, and a slight bit of uneasiness was
plainly perceptible in his tone.</p>

<p>“No?” said Benton, astonished.</p>

<p>“No,” again said Murdock, “and I am somewhat puzzled
to account for it, too. The searching parties must have passed
through the ravine, it is so near the settlement. I can not understand
it at all. I am sure that he was dead when we left
him. You examined him, Bob. Did he show any signs of
life?”</p>

<p>“Nary sign,” replied Bob, emphatically. But Bob’s examination
of the body of the man who had fallen by the bullet
of Murdock’s rifle, had been but a slight one, and Bob was
not likely to be a very close observer or be able to decide between
life and death in a doubtful case.</p>

<p>“I can not understand it,” said Murdock, absently. He
was indeed sorely puzzled by the strange circumstance. The
thought had occurred to him that, possibly, the shot that he
had aimed with such deadly intent at the heart of his rival
might have failed to accomplish the death of the young
stranger. Perhaps his rival still lived and might attempt to
wrest from him the prize he had toiled so to gain. The
thought was wormwood to him, yet he had brooded over it
all the way through the forest, thought of little else from the
time he left the settlement at Point Pleasant till he stood before
the lonely cabin by the Kanawha. “He may have escaped
death, but yet I do not see how it can possibly be. I am
sure I hit him fairly, and I do not often have to fire twice at
one mark.”</p>

<p>“Why, thar ain’t a doubt but what he’s gone under,” cried
Bob.</p>

<p>“But I do not understand how it is that the settlers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
searching for the girl did not come upon his body,” said Murdock.</p>

<p>“It is strange,” observed Benton.</p>

<p>“Jist as easy as rollin’ off a log,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“What is?” questioned Murdock.</p>

<p>“The reason why they didn’t find him.”</p>

<p>“Is there a reason?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Bob, confidently. “Didn’t you tumble
him over just before nightfall?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, do you s’pose the wolves would let him lay there
all night? No, sir.”</p>

<p>“The wolves, possibly, may have made away with the body,
but yet the bones would remain,” Murdock said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Why, no,” said Bob, “the wolves would naturally drag
the body off into the woods and the bones would be left thar!”</p>

<p>Murdock breathed easier after this possible solution of the
mystery. He had had a dreadful suspicion that he might see
again in the flesh the man whose life he had tried to take.</p>

<p>“Now to put my plan in execution,” Murdock said. “I
shall enter the cabin by the hole in the ground at the back of
the shanty, and represent to the girl that, at the peril of my life,
I have come to save her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it will work easy enough,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“I hope so; you had better wait till I get out of sight with
the girl; then make your way back to the settlement,” said
Murdock.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Bob, while Benton silently nodded his
head.</p>

<p>Then Murdock left the two and took a circle through the
wood which would bring him to the back of the cabin.</p>

<p>Bob watched Murdock until he was out of sight; then he
turned, abruptly, to Benton.</p>

<p>“Say, got any more corn-juice?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Benton, in a surly way.</p>

<p>“That’s a pity,” said Bob, reflectively.</p>

<p>“What did you want to go and drink it all up for?” asked
Benton, indignantly.</p>

<p>Benton that morning had produced a large flask of whisky,
and left it with Bob while he went off to shoot a squirrel for
breakfast. On his return he found that Bob had drank up
the entire contents of the flask and was in a drunken slumber.
He had just awakened out of it when Murdock came.</p>

<p>“It was ’tarnal good corn-juice,” said Bob, smacking his
lips at the remembrance.</p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t leave any for me to taste, so I don’t
know whether it was or not,” said Benton, in ill-humor.</p>

<p>“You didn’t come back, an’ I make a p’int never to let
whisky spile when I’m ’round to drink it up,” exclaimed
Bob.</p>

<p>“The next time you get any of my whisky to drink, I
reckon you’ll know it,” said Benton, significantly.</p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t get riled at a feller,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>From where the two stood they commanded a view of the
cabin. Their astonishment was great when they beheld Murdock
come from behind the cabin in evident agitation. He
stopped before the door of the log-house, which was fastened
on the outside by a rude bar—Murdock’s device to prevent
the escape of the prisoner. Then he beckoned for the two to
come to him.</p>

<p>Astonished, they obeyed the gesture. Evidently something
was the matter.</p>

<p>“Who saw the girl this morning?” demanded Murdock,
when they approached.</p>

<p>“I did,” responded Benton.</p>

<p>“At what time?”</p>

<p>“Just after sunrise.”</p>

<p>“And you have watched the cabin since then?”</p>

<p>“No, I was off in the woods for a little while.”</p>

<p>“But <em>you</em> remained,” Murdock said, turning to Bob; “you
watched the cabin in his absence?”</p>

<p>“Of course I did,” responded Bob, stoutly. “I never took
my eyes off of it.” Considering that he had been fast asleep
for about two hours, of which time Benton had been away,
Bob told his story with a good grace.</p>

<p>“I can not understand it,” muttered Murdock, an angry
cloud upon his brow. “The door is secure; the log behind,
just as I left it.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter, Clem?” asked Bob, who saw
plainly that something had gone wrong, though what it was,
he could not guess.</p>

<p>“Look for yourselves,” cried Murdock, angrily, throwing
open the door of the cabin as he spoke.</p>

<p>Eagerly the two looked in.</p>

<p>The cabin was empty! The girl was gone!</p>

<p>With blank faces the three looked at each other.</p>

<p>The girl had been spirited out of their hands by some
means, but how, they could not tell. There was no possible
solution to this mystery. No way by which the girl could
escape, and yet she was gone. Vanished without a trace of
the manner of her escape. Murdock was beaten, but how
or by whom he could not even guess.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE RENEGADE’S DAUGHTER.</span></h2>


<p>By the northern bank of the Kanawha, some five miles
from the settlement of Point Pleasant, stood a lonely cabin.
A little clearing surrounded it.</p>

<p>The cabin was situated about half a mile from the broad
trail leading from Point Pleasant to the Virginia settlements.</p>

<p>A narrow foot-path led from the broad trail to the lonely
cabin, but so little was it used and so dense had grown the
weeds and rank grass of the forest about it, that it would almost
have required the practiced eye of the savage, or his
rival in woodcraft, the white borderer, to have discovered the
existence of the path.</p>

<p>The cabin itself, though situated far from the line of civilization,
showed evident signs of human occupation.</p>

<p>The wild vines of the forest, transplanted from their native
fastness, twined and bloomed about the rough logs that
formed the walls of the cabin. And with the wild children
of the wood grew red and white roses, the floral gems that art
had plucked from nature.</p>

<p>A little garden patch, that showed plainly the traces of
careful tending, was on the further side of the cabin and extended
down near to the bank of the Kanawha.</p>

<p>This lonely cabin, far off in the wild woods, remote from
civilization, was the home of the strange, wayward girl
whom the settlers at Point Pleasant called Kanawha Kate,
and whom the red chiefs, in their fanciful way, termed the
“Queen of the Kanawha.”</p>

<p>In the interior of the lonely cabin a strange scene presented
itself to view.</p>

<p>On a rude couch of deer-skins lay a man. He was moaning,
helplessly, as if in great pain.</p>

<p>The shirt that covered his manly breast was stained with
blood.</p>

<p>From the position in which the wounded man lay—on his
side, with his face buried in the folds of the deer-skin—his features
were concealed from view, yet from the pallor of the little
part of his face that was visible, it was evident that the
man had been stricken nigh to death.</p>

<p>By the side of the suffering man knelt the brown-cheeked
beauty, Kanawha Kate.</p>

<p>Anxiously she bent over the stricken man. A little cup of
the muddy water from the Kanawha was by her side, and with
her hands, wet with the discolored drops, she bathed the feverish
temples of the wounded man.</p>

<p>Tender as a mother nursing her first-born, the girl laved the
hot flesh.</p>

<p>As the cooling touch of the wet, brown hand passed softly
over his temples, it seemed to ease the pain that racked the
muscular limbs.</p>

<p>The rigid lines of the face, distorted by the agony of pain,
grew soft. The moans of anguish were stilled. The simple
treatment of the girl was relieving the torture felt by the
stranger.</p>

<p>Eagerly the girl watched the face, and smiled when she saw
the muscles relax and the painful breathing become low and
regular.</p>

<p>“He will not die!” she cried, in joy, but barely speaking
above a whisper for fear of disturbing her patient.</p>

<p>“He will live and owe that life to me. Oh! what joy in the
thought!” Then a few moments she remained silent, watching
the pale face before her with many a long, loving look.</p>

<p>Few of the settlers at Point Pleasant who had seen Kanawha
Kate roaming the forest, rifle in hand—as good a woodman
as any one among them—would have guessed that, within the
heart of the forest-queen was a world of tenderness and love.</p>

<p>They had seen her bring down the brown deer with a single
shot, wing an eagle in his airy circle in the sky and bring the
kingly bird tumbling to earth; had seen her when the Ohio,
lashed into white, crested waves by the mad winds, bid defiance
to the boldest boatman to dare to cross it, launch her
dug-out and fearlessly commit herself to the mercy of the dashing
waters.</p>

<p>How could they guess that with the dauntless courage of a
lion, she also possessed the tender and loving heart of a woman?
But so it was.</p>

<p>“It was Heaven that sent me to his aid,” she murmured,
gazing fondly on the white face. “How beautiful he is; how
unlike the rough fellows in yonder settlement,” and the girl’s
lip curled contemptuously as she spoke.</p>

<p>“He is a king to them. Oh! what would I not give to win
his love; but that thought is folly. I am despised by all; but
no, there is one who speaks fairly to and thinks kindly of me—Virginia
Treveling. She has a noble heart. She is the only
one in yonder settlement who has not treated me with scorn
and yet fate has decreed that we shall stand in each other’s
way.” Mournful was the voice of the girl as the words came
from her lips; sorrowful was the look upon her face.</p>

<p>“It is a hopeless passion that I am nourishing in my heart.
I must not love him, for I can never hope to win a return of
that love.”</p>

<p>Sadly she looked upon the wounded man.</p>

<p>A footfall outside the cabin attracted her attention. Quickly
she bounded to her feet and seized the rifle that hung over
the rude fire-place. Then she stood still and listened.</p>

<p>“Who can it be that seeks the home of the outcast girl?”
she murmured, as with eager ears, every sense on the alert,
she listened.</p>

<p>“Can it be one of the settlers from Point Pleasant? No;
but few of them know of my dwelling-place, and fewer still
would care to seek it. Is it a red-skin? No; I would not have
heard his footfall if he comes in malice.”</p>

<p>Then the girl heard the sound of footsteps approaching the
house.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed the girl, suddenly, as a thought flashed
through her mind; “perhaps it is his foes coming to seek
him,” and her glance was on the wounded man as she spoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
“If so they had better have sought the den of the wolf, or the
nest of the rattlesnake than my cabin. They must kill me before
they shall harm him.”</p>

<p>Hardly had the speech come from her lips when a bold
knock sounded on the door.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” cried Kate.</p>

<p>The door—a heavy one, braced strongly—was barred on the
inside and was fully stout enough to defy the strength of a
dozen men, let alone one.</p>

<p>“Open and you will see,” responded a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>The girl started when the tones fell upon her ear.</p>

<p>“Can it be he?” she muttered, and wonder was in her
voice.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you answer, gal?” exclaimed the voice of the
stranger. “Don’t you know me, or have you forgotten your
own flesh and blood?”</p>

<p>“It is my father,” she murmured, but there was little love in
the tones.</p>

<p>Then, without further parley, she unbarred the door. It
swung back slowly on its rusty hinges and a tall, powerfully
built man, clad in a deer-skin garb fashioned after the Indian
style, entered the room.</p>

<p>The stranger was the same man whom we have seen in the
Shawnee village, Girty’s companion, by name David Kendrick.</p>

<p>He, too, like Girty was execrated by the settlers. An adopted
son of the great Shawnee nation, with his red brothers he had
stained his hands in the blood of the men whose skins were
white like his own.</p>

<p>There was little love expressed in the face of Kate as she
looked upon her father, for the renegade Kendrick bore that
relation to her, though by the inhabitants of Point Pleasant
it was generally supposed that she was some relation to Girty;
but that was not the truth.</p>

<p>“Well, gal, how are you?” questioned the new-comer,
roughly. But before the girl could reply, the eyes of Kendrick
fell upon the figure of the wounded man stretched upon the
couch of skins.</p>

<p>“Hullo! who’s this, eh? Hain’t been getting a husband
since I’ve been up in the Shawnee country, have you?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the girl, scornfully and quickly.</p>

<p>“Needn’t get riled ’bout it,” said the father, bluntly. “Who
is he, anyway?”</p>

<p>“A wounded stranger whose life I have been trying to
save.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose you’re in love with him, eh?” asked Kendrick, with
a covert glance from under his heavy brows at the girl.</p>

<p>“In love with him! What good would it do me to fall in
love with any decent white man? Am I not <em>your</em> daughter?
the child of a renegade?” exclaimed the girl, bitterly.</p>

<p>“Better come with me and I’ll find you a husband in some
of the great chiefs of the Shawnee nation.”</p>

<p>“I’d blow out my brains with my own rifle first,” cried the
girl, angrily.</p>

<p>“Don’t get your back up; I only suggested it. You’ve got
the temper of an angel, you have. If you ever <em>do</em> get a husband,
you’ll comb his hair with a three-legged stool, I reckon,
whether his skin is white or red.”</p>

<p>The girl made no reply, but turned away her head with a
look of scorn.</p>

<p>“Seein’ as how I was ’round the clearing I thought I’d call
in and see how you was. I didn’t expect to find the old cabin
turned into a hospital.”</p>

<p>“Would you have had me leave this poor fellow to die in
the wood, like a dog?” asked the girl, spiritedly.</p>

<p>“Life ain’t worth much, anyway,” said the renegade, contemptuously.
“One man ain’t missed in this hyer big world.”</p>

<p>“What brings you so near to the station?” asked Kate.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it natural that a white man should want to see some
of his own color, once in awhile?” asked Kendrick, with a
grin.</p>

<p>“Your color!” said the girl, in scorn, “though your face is
white yet your heart is red! yes, as red as your hand has been
with blood. In yonder settlement they call you the white Indian,
and they would tear you to pieces if they could get their
hands upon you—show you as little mercy as they would show
a wolf.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, gal, true as preachin’; but do you suppose
the hate’s all on one side? I reckon not,” and the renegade
laughed discordantly. “I’ve seen many a white man dance
while the red flames were burning his life away, and I’ve
laughed at the sight.”</p>

<p>“And the guilt and shame that belongs to you clings to me
also. I am your daughter, and that I am so is a curse upon
my life. It has made me an outcast—forced me to seek a home
far from the bounds of civilization. It has deadened all the
good in my nature. It is a wonder that I am not thoroughly
bad, for all think me so.” The tone in which the girl spoke
showed plainly how deeply she felt the cruel truth.</p>

<p>“Inside of a month the settlers at Point Pleasant won’t jeer
at you,” said Kendrick, meaningly.</p>

<p>“What will keep them from it?” asked Kate, in wonder.</p>

<p>“Ke-ne-ha-ha and his Shawnees. There’s a hurricane
coming, gal, and Point Pleasant will be the first to feel it. Let
’em laugh now, they’ll cry tears of blood soon.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE WOUNDED MAN.</span></h2>


<p>“Within a week every red brave in the Shawnee nation
will be on the war-path, and with the Shawnees are the
Wyandots and the Mingoes. Thar’s a bloody time ahead,
gal.”</p>

<p>“And you are leagued with the red fiends,” said Kate, indignantly.</p>

<p>“And ar’n’t I red now, too?” returned Kendrick, with a
frown—“red at heart, although my skin may be white.
But, gal, I’ve come to give you warning of this attack, so that
you can look out for yourself in your expeditions in the
forest. The Indians will be as thick as bees between here and
the Ohio. And if they should come across you in the forest
your scalp might adorn the belt of some one of my red brothers.
Not that I think that any of the Shawnee tribe would
harm a hair of your head, that is, if they knew who you was.
But in the wood they won’t be apt to examine very closely,
till they put a bullet through you.”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid,” said the girl, scornfully. “I do not
think there are many of the Shawnee warriors that are a
match for me in woodcraft.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, gal; I’ll back you ag’in’ ‘lifting a trail’ with
any red-man that ever stepped.”</p>

<p>“Do not fear for me; I can take care of myself.”</p>

<p>“By the way, gal, thar’s one thing I want to ask you,”
said the renegade, suddenly. “In your wanderings about in
the forest, did you ever see a strange-looking creature with the
body of a wolf and the face of a human?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the girl, in wonder.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think of it, gal. Thar’s something—whether
man, beast, or demon, no one knows—a-hunting
the Shawnee nation. It attacks the warriors, singly, in the
forest. Kills them with a single lick of a tomahawk, and
then cuts on their breasts three knife-slashes, making a red
arrow.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen it?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>“Me? no,” replied the renegade.</p>

<p>“It is probably but an Indian fable; such a creature as you
describe can not exist.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve seen the dead Indians, though, with the red arrow
cut on their breasts; thar’s no mistake about that,” said
Kendrick.</p>

<p>“I have never met any such figure as you describe in the
forest.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon it’s the devil, after all.”</p>

<p>“Father, you understand the treatment of wounds, do you
not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a little.”</p>

<p>“Can you not extract the ball from this stranger’s wound?”</p>

<p>“Well, I kin try.”</p>

<p>And then the renegade bent over the sleeping man. With
his keen-edged hunting-knife he ripped open the stranger’s
shirt.</p>

<p>Silently, for a few moments, Kendrick examined the wound;
then with his strong arms he turned the stranger over, gently.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, gal; ’tain’t nothing but a flesh wound. The
ball has passed right through the side just under the shoulder.
He’s suffering more from loss of blood than any thing
else. A few days will fix him all right. Just bind up the
wound. Put on a bandage and a poultice of these leaves,”
and the renegade drew a handful of leaves from the Indian
pouch that hung by his side, and gave them to the girl. “It’s
a Shawnee medicine and powerful healing. Just chew the
leaves up and apply them wet to the wound. And now, I
must be going. It ain’t much use for you to waste your time
curing this young fellow, because, if he stays round hyer, the
savages will have his scalp afore he’s a week older. Look out
for yourself, now.” And, with this parting injunction, the
renegade left the house.</p>

<p>“And to think that this man, a renegade to his country
and his kin, a consort with the red Indians, is my father,” the
girl muttered, bitterly.</p>

<p>Then she proceeded to dress the wound of the stranger.
She applied the leaves as directed by the renegade. Then
bound them tightly in their place with strips of cotton.</p>

<p>The cooling influence of the simple savage remedy seemed
to give almost instant relief to the wounded man.</p>

<p>Anxiously she watched the expression of his face.</p>

<p>A few minutes of silence ensued. Then the stranger, with
a sigh, turned, restlessly, on the deer-skin couch and awoke.</p>

<p>The wounded man was Harvey Winthrop.</p>

<p>Wolf and carrion-bird alike had been cheated of their banquet
of blood by the timely arrival of the Kanawha Queen.</p>

<p>In astonishment, Winthrop looked around him.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he muttered, in a haze.</p>

<p>“In safety, in my poor cabin,” said Kate, softly.</p>

<p>Winthrop gave a slight start as the tone of her voice fell
upon his ear.</p>

<p>He turned his glance upon the girl, and in a moment recognized
her.</p>

<p>“Kate!” he exclaimed, in astonishment.</p>

<p>A warm blush, accompanied by a look of delight, swept
over the girl’s face as Winthrop pronounced her name.</p>

<p>“You remember me, then?” she said, in joy.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. Am I likely to forget one who saved my
life? and now I suppose I owe a double debt, another life;
for, as I guess, to you again I owe my existence.”</p>

<p>“I found you in the forest, wounded and senseless,” said the
girl, simply.</p>

<p>“In the same ravine where I met you, was it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Strange that twice in that one spot I should have come so
near to death and yet escaped it.”</p>

<p>“It was Providence that sent me to your aid. I know not
why I directed my steps to that spot,” and a half blush was
on her face as she spoke, for, to speak truthfully, she should
have said that it was a secret but earnest wish to look again
upon the scene where she had met the handsome stranger,
that led her to the ravine. But that truth she would not own
even to herself.</p>

<p>“I thank both Heaven and yourself for the timely rescue,”
said Winthrop, earnestly.</p>

<p>“How did you receive your wound?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” replied Winthrop, with a puzzled air.</p>

<p>“You do not know!” exclaimed Kate, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“No, I was shot down without warning. I heard the sharp
report of the rifle, then felt the burning sensation of the bullet
tearing through my side, and then—I knew no more, until I
awoke from my swoon a moment ago.”</p>

<p>“I can not understand it,” said Kate, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Nor can I. I have not an enemy in the world, that I know
of, and here too in the West I am a stranger; have only been
here a few days; hardly time enough to make acquaintances,
let alone enemies. Perhaps, though, it was one of the savages
that attacked me; to them all white men are foes.”</p>

<p>“No Indian bullet stretched you on the earth,” said Kate, decidedly.
“Had it been an Indian that shot you, he would
have taken your scalp instantly, as a trophy of victory; such
is the custom of the red-men. You must have been insensible
for some time when I reached your side, for quite a little pool
of blood, that had flowed from your wound, was on the ground,
and, as I came up, a huge gray wolf stole away into the thicket,
and a crow winged its flight up through the tree-tops. Had
there been Indians near, the wolf and crow would not have
been by your side.”</p>

<p>Winthrop shuddered when he thought of what his fate would
have been but for the timely arrival of the girl.</p>

<p>“It is all a mystery to me,” Winthrop said, absently. “I
can not understand why any one should desire my death.”</p>

<p>“And whoever attempted your life has a white skin, and
not a red one; of that you may be sure,” said Kate, decidedly.</p>

<p>“I can not guess the riddle.”</p>

<p>Then for the first time to Winthrop’s mind came the thought
of Virginia Treveling.</p>

<p>“And Miss Treveling?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Kate looked at him in wonder. She could not understand
the meaning of the exclamation.</p>

<p>“Miss Treveling?” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes; was she not with me, when you discovered me helpless?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Kate, in utter astonishment.</p>

<p>“Why, this is a greater mystery than even the attack on me.
Miss Treveling was with me in the ravine when I was shot.”</p>

<p>“She was?”</p>

<p>“Yes; what could have become of her?”</p>

<p>“I can not guess.”</p>

<p>“Could she have returned to Point Pleasant for assistance?”</p>

<p>“She would not have left you to bleed to death.”</p>

<p>“You did not see her?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Would you have met had she gone to the station? Did
you come from that direction?”</p>

<p>“No, I entered the ravine from the east by an old Indian
trail.”</p>

<p>“And my rifle, my knife?” exclaimed Winthrop, glancing
around the room, as though he expected to see his weapons in
some corner.</p>

<p>“There were no weapons near you.”</p>

<p>“I have it at last—a clue to this mysterious attack,” exclaimed
Winthrop, excitedly. “Miss Treveling has been carried
off. The ruffians, whoever they are, shot me down that
they might secure her.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, in Kate’s mind came the dreadful suspicion
that her father, the renegade, might have had something to do
with the attack on Winthrop; but then in an instant she dismissed
the thought as unworthy of belief, for her father had not
acted toward the wounded man as if he had been his assassin.</p>

<p>“There are many wild and dangerous characters on the borders
of the Ohio. Men whose lawless lives have driven them
from civilization to the forest wilds; yet I should not think
that there would be any one of them desperate enough to seize
upon General Treveling’s daughter, nor can I understand what
they would gain by so doing.”</p>

<p>“You are sure that the attacking party were not Indians?”</p>

<p>“Yes; first, because they would have taken your scalp;
second, there is now peace along the Ohio border between the
white men and the red, although no one can tell how soon the
tomahawk will be again uplifted.” The words of her father,
the renegade, relative to the Indian expedition, were fresh in
her mind as she spoke.</p>

<p>“I am certain that I was shot down like a dog, without
mercy, that she might be carried away. The pain of my wound
is nothing now to the pain in my heart when I think of what
may be her fate.”</p>

<p>Deep with anguish were the tones that came from the lips
of the young man, and sorrowful was the cloud that darkened
his face.</p>

<p>Mournfully Kate gazed upon him, but she spoke not.</p>

<p>“Lady, you can judge of my sufferings when I tell you that
Virginia Treveling is my plighted wife. The words binding
her life to mine had just passed her lips when the shot of the
assassin struck me to her feet.”</p>

<p>Each word that he spoke was like a dagger-thrust to Kate.
She felt a deathlike faintness come over her, but with an effort
that tried all her powers, she repressed the agony that was
tearing her heart.</p>

<p>“She is to be your wife?” she said, rising.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I will find her. If she is within a hundred miles of the
Ohio, wood, swamp or village shall not hide her from me.”</p>

<p>She snatched her rifle from the wall, and in a moment was
gone.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">VIRGINIA’S ESCAPE.</span></h2>


<p>Alone, a helpless captive in the hands of the dreaded red-men,
Virginia felt that her situation was indeed a terrible one.
Then, too, she had seen her lover fall helpless at her feet,
struck down by the fatal shot of the ambushed foe. What his
fate had been, even if he had not been killed outright by the
ball that tore him from her arms and laid him prostrate on the
earth, it was not difficult to guess. The red warriors rarely
spared a fallen foe, and, in imagination, she saw the fair-haired
scalp of the man she loved so well, dangling at the girdle of
some brawny Indian chief.</p>

<p>With such thoughts as these passing rapidly through her
mind, the terror of her situation was doubly increased.</p>

<p>On a rude bench that stood in a corner of the cabin, Virginia
sat motionless as a statue, and wept many a bitter tear.</p>

<p>What her fate was to be, she understood only too well. A
girl reared on the border, she understood the customs of the
savages that claimed the valley of the Ohio as their own. And
over her soul crept a sickening fear when she thought of the
life that was in store for her, a slave to some Indian brave.</p>

<p>There was little chance of rescue. A miracle alone could
save her.</p>

<p>A low knock at the door roused her from her abstraction.</p>

<p>How long she remained in the cabin she could not tell, but
she knew that some hours must have passed away.</p>

<p>The cabin door opened slowly, and a man dressed in frontier
fashion entered, cautiously.</p>

<p>It was the man who had called himself Benton. Of course
he was unknown to the girl. Benton had washed off the war-paint,
and appeared a white man, as he was.</p>

<p>A cry of joy rose to Virginia’s lips and she sprung to her
feet, but at a sign of caution from him she restrained herself.</p>

<p>To her the face of a white man gave hope of deliverance.
She had little suspicion that all her captors were of her own
color, and not of the dusky hue of the savage.</p>

<p>“Be silent and cautious,” said Benton, in a whisper; “a
word above a breath may cost both of us our lives.”</p>

<p>“You will save me from the hands of these terrible savages?”
murmured the girl.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will try to,” replied Benton, “but it will be a task
of danger. You must follow my instructions to the letter or
we will never escape the toils that surround us.”</p>

<p>“I will do so,” replied Virginia, quickly.</p>

<p>“Come, then; tread cautiously. The savages have left but
one man to guard the house, and he has fallen asleep in the
thicket.”</p>

<p>Then Benton led the way from the house, and the girl followed,
cautiously.</p>

<p>The two passed close to where Bob Tierson lay in the
bushes, fast asleep.</p>

<p>Benton, in leaving the flask of potent corn-juice with the
worthy Bob, had rightly calculated that Bob would speedily
dispose of the contents, and get gloriously drunk on the same.</p>

<p>The trap that the swarthy-skinned stranger had laid had
caught the redoubtable Bob, and once he had fallen into deep
and heavy slumber, it was an easy task for Benton to remove
the prisoner from the log cabin.</p>

<p>Benton had fastened the bar again across the door of the
house, so that it seemed all secure, and left no trace of the
prisoner’s escape.</p>

<p>When they had crossed the little clearing, and gained the
shelter of the wood, Benton halted.</p>

<p>“Now, young lady, I must take you in my arms and carry
you for a little while, so that the ground shall bear no traces by
which you may be tracked and recaptured. These red-skins
have the scent of a bloodhound, and the moment they discover
your escape they will scour the country for miles around
in search of you. Therefore, for your safety as well as for my
own, we must leave, in border parlance, a blind trail.”</p>

<p>“Adopt any method that you please to secure my escape
from these terrible savages and I will bless you for it,” said
Virginia, earnestly.</p>

<p>Benton raised the light figure of the girl in his strong arms
as though she had been a child, and then rapidly threaded his
way through the forest.</p>

<p>The course that Benton followed led toward the Ohio, and
ran parallel with the Kanawha.</p>

<p>For some thirty minutes, with rapid steps, Benton went onward,
making his way through the thicket without doubt or
hesitation, as if he were perfectly familiar with the country.</p>

<p>At the end of the thirty minutes he halted on the edge of a
little clearing, close by the banks of the Kanawha. In the
center of the clearing stood a log-cabin, something like the one
which had held Virginia a prisoner.</p>

<p>The cabin, too, like the other, was deserted. The perpetual
danger existing of Indian attacks had caused the settlers
to seek the protection of the station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“There, young lady, this must be your home for a little
while,” said Benton, as he strode into the cabin and placed
Virginia upon her feet.</p>

<p>“Must I remain here?” asked the girl, in wonder.</p>

<p>“Yes, for a short time,” replied Benton.</p>

<p>“But why not take me at once to Point Pleasant?”</p>

<p>“Why it would probably cost both of us our lives should
we attempt to reach the station at present,” replied Benton.
“The woods between here and the mouth of the river are
swarming with red-skins. You can judge how bold they are,
when they dared attack and carry you off from so near the
station.”</p>

<p>Virginia had little idea that one of her captors, one of the
“red-men,” was even then speaking to her.</p>

<p>“Did you see my capture in the ravine?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I was concealed in the bushes. I did not dare to show
myself, for the Indians were too strong. But I followed,
hoping to get the chance by cunning to get you out of their
hands.”</p>

<p>“And the young man that was with me?” Virginia asked,
tremblingly. She wished to learn the truth, yet feared to.</p>

<p>“He was killed by the shot that struck him, fired by one of
the Indians,” and Benton spoke what he believed to be the
truth. He did not believe it possible that Winthrop could
have survived his wound.</p>

<p>Virginia’s heart sunk within her at the fatal news. Her
lover dead, she felt almost willing to die too.</p>

<p>“You remain here and I will go at once to Point Pleasant,
find your father, tell him where you are, and then with a
party strong enough to cope with the red-skins, he can come
and rescue you.”</p>

<p>The plan was reasonable enough, and Virginia could find
no fault with it, though she trembled to remain alone in the
cabin while the woods around swarmed with hostile Indians.</p>

<p>“Suppose the savages should discover my retreat while you
are absent?” Virginia asked.</p>

<p>“There is very little danger of that. All the Indians, with
the exception of the party that captured you, have kept on
the other side of the Kanawha. There is nothing to bring
them on this side of the river. Keep within the shelter of
the house. I will return by nightfall with your father and
his friends.”</p>

<p>“Heaven will reward you, sir, I am sure, for this kindness
to a helpless girl,” said Virginia, earnestly.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” replied Benton, with a grim smile upon his
sallow face. Then he left the house, crossed the clearing, and
disappeared in the thicket.</p>

<p>Virginia sunk upon her knees and poured out her heartfelt
thanks to the Great Power that was, apparently, watching so
carefully over her life, and had brought a stranger to rescue
her from the terrible danger that had menaced her well-being.</p>

<p>Poor, innocent girl, she knew not that as she was thanking
Heaven for her rescue, the snare was still close around her;
that the man whom she looked upon as a friend and deliverer
was a more deadly foe than any painted warrior that roamed
the forests of the Ohio valley.</p>

<p>No Indian is so terrible as the renegade to his country and
his kin, the white-faced savage.</p>

<p>Once within the thicket, Benton gave vent to a grim laugh
of triumph.</p>

<p>“The bird is in the net, and yet she imagines she is free!
Oh, this will be a glorious vengeance. Once before, years
ago, I made the heart of my enemy writhe with anguish, and
now again I tear it. And this cunning plotter, Murdock,
would use me as his tool. In yonder settlement for the moment
I was in his power. Had he but spoken my name aloud,
the settlers would have torn me to pieces with as little mercy
as the wolves show to the wounded deer. But here, in the
free woods, the tide of affairs is changed. Here I own no man
as master.”</p>

<p>On through the forest, retracing his steps toward the cabin
where Virginia had been confined, he went.</p>

<p>“Watega’s death I can not understand,” he said, musingly,
communing with himself as he walked onward. “Can it be
possible that there is a spirit-form that haunts the woods and
marks the Indians for his prey? It is almost beyond belief,
and yet there is no disputing the terrible evidence of his
hand. Watega was a great brave; few warriors in the
Shawnee tribe as good as he, and yet he falls by the hand of
this Wolf Demon, apparently without even a struggle for his
life, if the words of Kenton can be believed, and he always
speaks the truth. Can it be that it is some borderer in disguise
that is doing this terrible work? No, that is improbable.
Is it then a fiend from below that walks the earth in this
dreadful shape? It is beyond my comprehension. I’d like to
have him within rifle range once more, though; I’d soon
prove whether the Wolf Demon be a demon indeed, or a mortal
in a wolf’s skin.”</p>

<p>Proceeding rapidly onward with his swinging stride, Benton
soon reached the cabin again. Bob was, as he had left
him, fast asleep in the bushes.</p>

<p>The events that followed the arrival of Clement Murdock—how
he found the cabin deserted and his prisoner gone—we
have already related.</p>

<p>“Well, dog-gone my cats, if ’tain’t funny,” said Bob,
scratching his head in wonder.</p>

<p>“I can not account for it!” cried Murdock, angrily.</p>

<p>“I wonder if this ’ere clearin’s got any spooks ’round it?”
said Bob, with a nervous glance about him.</p>

<p>“One thing is certain, the girl is gone,” observed Benton.</p>

<p>“Yes, but how?” exclaimed Murdock.</p>

<p>“Maybe she clumb out of the roof,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“The roof is tight, you fool!” said Murdock, angrily.</p>

<p>“You needn’t bite a feller’s head off ’cos he opened it,”
growled Bob.</p>

<p>“Let us search the forest; she may be concealed near
here,” Murdock said.</p>

<p>We have omitted to state that Benton had replaced the
war-paint upon his face before coming again to the little
clearing.</p>

<p>“That will be your best plan,” observed Benton. “I
wish you luck,” and as he spoke he turned upon his heel to
depart.</p>

<p>“You are not going?” Murdock asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have kept my word with you and did what I promised,
and now my way lies different from yours.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll keep your secret.”</p>

<p>“What do I care, now that I am out of the stockade of
Point Pleasant, whether you do or not? Here, in the woods
I fear no man,” and, with the haughty speech, the stranger
departed. His form was soon lost to view among the foliage
of the forest.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a cuss, now, anyway,” said Bob, looking after
the stranger in astonishment.</p>

<p>“A man better to have for a friend than an enemy,” said
Murdock, quietly; “but, come, let us see if we can not discover
some traces of the girl.”</p>

<p>At the end of an hour the two were no wiser than when
they began.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">A TERRIBLE FRIEND.</span></h2>


<p>Boone gazed in astonishment at the tall figure that, in
spite of the gloom that enshrouded the interior of the Indian
wigwam, he could distinguish standing in the center of the
lodge.</p>

<p>With noiseless steps the dark form moved to the door of
the wigwam and listened for a moment. Then it lifted the
skin that served for a door and peered out into the gloom of
the night.</p>

<p>“Who the deuce can it be?” mused Boone, as, a helpless
prisoner on the couch of skins, he watched the movements of
the unknown.</p>

<p>“It ain’t Kenton or Lark, I’m putty sure, ’cos it’s too big
for either of ’em. Who on yearth can it be? A friend, anyway,
and friends are allers welcome, particularly when a feller’s
in sich a ’tarnal tight place as I am now. I s’pect they’ll
roast me to-morrow, and eat me, too, for that matter, if I
wasn’t so ’tarnal tough.”</p>

<p>Swelling on the night-air came the distant whoops of the
savages.</p>

<p>Apparently satisfied with his scrutiny, the unknown let
fall the skin that served as the wigwam door, and again advanced
to Boone.</p>

<p>“Say, stranger, this is a pesky fix,” said Boone, in a low
and cautious tone.</p>

<p>The unknown answered not, but knelt by the side of the
prostrate man.</p>

<p>Then Boone felt two powerful arms seize him, and roll
him over on his side. As the hands of the mysterious stranger
touched him, Boone felt a cold shiver creep all over him.
The hands of the stranger seemed to be armed with claws
like the paws of a beast.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem, stranger!” muttered Boone, “you ought to
cut your finger-nails; they stick right into a feller; and why
didn’t you tell me to turn over? I kin do that well enough,
although I’m in a pesky fix hyer.”</p>

<p>Then Boone heard the slight grating noise that a knife
makes cutting through leather.</p>

<p>The old hunter guessed the truth in an instant. The mysterious
unknown was cutting the thongs that bound his arms.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, stranger!” cried Boone, cautiously; “you
don’t say much, but you work well.”</p>

<p>A moment more and the bonds that bound Boone’s arms
loosened. The tension gone, the stout deer-skin severed by
the keen-edged steel, and the arms of the hunter were free.</p>

<p>With a grunt of relief, Boone stretched his arms in the
air. Confined as they had been, the sensation of freedom was
a pleasant one.</p>

<p>As carelessly the hunter extended his arms in the air, one
of his hands touched the arm of the stranger. Again a cold
shiver came over Boone.</p>

<p>“By hookey!” he muttered, to himself; “either your hunting-shirt’s
made of bear-skin, or else you’ve more hair on
your arm than I have on my head. I don’t understand this
riffle a bit; but it’s a friend, anyway, whoever he is.”</p>

<p>Then the stranger cut the thongs that bound Boone’s feet.</p>

<p>Again the hand of the stranger touched the hunter, and
again it seemed to him as if that hand was armed with the
claws of an animal.</p>

<p>“I wish the derned critter <em>would</em> say something,” muttered
Boone, slightly uneasy. “If he wasn’t acting so much like
a human I should think that it was a pet b’ar that had got
hold on me.”</p>

<p>The stranger rose to his feet.</p>

<p>Boone followed his example.</p>

<p>“It’s a pleasant thing to be free, stranger,” Boone said,
trying to look into the face of the strange being who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
come so aptly to his rescue. But the gloom of the wigwam
hid the face and form of the unknown with an ebon mask.</p>

<p>Besides, too, the unknown had taken a couple of blankets
from a lot that lay in the corner of the wigwam, and wrapped
one around his waist and the other over his head, when he
had first entered the lodge.</p>

<p>The stranger stooped, took up another blanket, and gave it
into Boone’s hands. The unknown seemed to possess the
cat-like faculty of seeing in the dark.</p>

<p>As he gave the blanket into Boone’s grasp, again his hand
touched that of the hunter.</p>

<p>“By jingo! his finger nails are awful,” muttered the hunter,
to himself. “If his toe-nails are as long, I shouldn’t
like to have him for a bedfellow. If he kicked any, he’d
scratch a man half to death.”</p>

<p>The unknown took hold of a corner of Boone’s blanket
and raised it a little in the air.</p>

<p>Boone understood what the unknown meant in an instant.</p>

<p>“You want me to put it round my head, eh, so as to kiver
up my face?”</p>

<p>A vigorous tug at the blanket answered the hunter.</p>

<p>“I s’pose you mean yes by that, hey?”</p>

<p>Then a second tug came.</p>

<p>“All right, I understand,” said Boone; “but why in thunder
can’t you speak and let a feller know what you mean?”</p>

<p>The stranger moved to the door of the wigwam, still keeping
his hold on the corner of Boone’s blanket. The old hunter
followed him.</p>

<p>At the door the unknown paused for a moment, as if to
listen.</p>

<p>“Goin’ right through the Injin village?” said Boone, in
astonishment.</p>

<p>The stranger answered as before by a vigorous tug at the
blanket.</p>

<p>“Why in thunder don’t you answer a feller?” asked the
hunter, thoroughly puzzled at the strange silence of the unknown
who had come so timely to his rescue.</p>

<p>The stranger replied not, but raised the skin that hung at
the door and passed out into the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>“I’ll see who it is, or what it is when we get outside,”
muttered Boone, to himself. “He acts more like a brute than
a human. Derned if I like a man that can’t answer a civil
question. There’s a moon, so I can see what sort of a critter
he is; but, by jingo! the same light that shows him to me
will also show us to the Injins. This is goin’ to be a narrow
squeeze.”</p>

<p>But the unknown had no idea of issuing from the door of
the wigwam into the Indian village.</p>

<p>A single glance had shown the stranger that three stalwart
warriors, seated a few paces from the lodge, kept vigilant
watch upon it.</p>

<p>Still keeping his hold upon the blanket, the mysterious
being who had so astonished the old hunter by his silence,
moved with noiseless step across the wigwam to the back of
it, where he, by aid of his knife, had gained entrance to it.
Boone, guided by the movement of the blanket—for it was
almost too dark to distinguish forms—followed.</p>

<p>“Well, now, this is sense,” said Boone, approvingly; “we
may stand a chance to get clear of the red heathen.”</p>

<p>Boone felt that the stranger was lifting his corner of the
blanket into the air, then he flung it over Boone’s head.</p>

<p>“Wrap my head up? Of course; that’s a ’cute dodge,”
and the hunter chuckled to himself. “If any of the pizen
Shawnees happen to see me, they won’t be able to tell me
from one of their own tribe with my head kivered up, ’cos
my legs are kivered with buck-skin leggin’s, same as their
own.”</p>

<p>Boone wrapped the blanket carelessly round his head, Indian
fashion.</p>

<p>Then the stranger, who seemed to be able to distinguish
the movements of the hunter, in spite of the darkness, passed
through the hole he had previously cut in the skins that
formed the side of the Indian lodge, and gained the open
air.</p>

<p>Boone followed.</p>

<p>“Now I kin see who it is,” muttered Boone, as he emerged
into the air from the confines of the lodge.</p>

<p>But, even as he spoke, a great, black cloud came rapidly
over the face of the moon and vailed its silvery rays of light
from the earth.</p>

<p>All that Boone could make out in the darkness was, that,
by his side, was standing a stalwart form, even overtopping
himself in hight, tall as he was. But the form was wrapped
so completely in Indian blankets from the head to the feet,
that the hunter could distinguish neither feature nor limb.</p>

<p>“Well, dog-gone my persimmons!” said the hunter, in disgust,
“I’d like to see what and who the critter is that I’m
owing my life to.”</p>

<p>The stranger listened, intently, for a moment.</p>

<p>In the position the two were standing, the lodge completely
hid them from view of the village. In front of them
ran the turbid waters of the Scioto.</p>

<p>The stranger moved, slowly and cautiously, to the bank of
the river.</p>

<p>Boone noticed that his footfall gave out no sound, and
that, too, he moved with a singular motion, unlike the gait
of a human. The hunter could see this despite the darkness
that surrounded them.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem, what on yearth is this critter, anyway?” muttered
the hunter, in amazement. “He stands on his feet like
a man, and he walks with the waddle of a b’ar.”</p>

<p>Boone, stout woodman as he was, tried in courage, a man
that laughed at danger and faced death coolly and without
shrinking, felt a cold shiver come over him as he watched the
movements of the mysterious being who was so free in his
actions and so sparing of his words.</p>

<p>The old hunter could not understand the peculiar feeling
that was so gradually stealing over him. The hair upon his
head seemed ready to bristle with fright.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I had jumped into an ice-cold river,” muttered
Boone, with a half-shiver.</p>

<p>For a moment he took his eyes from the dark form behind
him; when he looked again, the form was gone. Naught
before him broke the denseness of the gloom.</p>

<p>The hunter rubbed his eyes in wonder.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem!” he muttered, “is it a spook after all?” The
hair upon his head rose in fright as the thought crossed his
mind.</p>

<p>Then Boone proceeded cautiously onward.</p>

<p>A few paces and he stood upon the river’s bank. The waters
of the stream, now low—it was in the summer-time—were
some feet below the surface of the bank. One walking by the
side of the water would be concealed from the view of any
one on the level plain above, by the overhanging bank.</p>

<p>Here was an easy solution to the mystery of the strange
disappearance of Boone’s silent friend. He had stepped from
the level down the slope to the side of the stream, and thus
hid by the bank had seemed to disappear.</p>

<p>But Boone was loth to adopt this explanation of the riddle;
besides, as he stepped down the bank to the water’s
edge, he could not distinguish the dark form of the stranger
anywhere.</p>

<p>“It was a spook, sure,” muttered Boone; “but, I may as
well be making tracks for the settlement.”</p>

<p>Concealed by the bank, Boone proceeded onward until his
progress was stopped by an unexpected obstacle.</p>

<p>He had come to the watering-place for the Indian horses.
A road had been cut through the bank to the water, and in
the road sat a brawny Shawnee warrior.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A STRANGE APPEARANCE.</span></h2>


<p>“Durn the critter! he’s right in the way!” muttered the
old hunter, as his eyes fell upon the figure of the savage, sitting
in the pathway leading to the river.</p>

<p>Just then, too, the moon shone out bright and clear.</p>

<p>The position of Boone was one of danger. Although the
shelving bank hid him from the view of any one that might
be on the level plain above, yet he was in full view of the
savage in the horse-path, if that worthy chose to turn his
head and look in his direction.</p>

<p>“What in thunder was the use of that terrible critter—whatever
he was—a-gettin’ me out of the wigwam, if I’m goin’
to be captivated ag’in, right on the jump?”</p>

<p>Boone did not dare to move lest the noise might reach the
ears of the Indian.</p>

<p>“If the moon would only go under a cloud ag’in, I might
be able to skulk round him; but then, the chances are ten to
one that some one of the Indians in the village would see me.
This is a pesky fix now, for sure.”</p>

<p>Boone was in a quandary. To advance was clearly out of
the question. To remain where he was would be sure to lead
to his discovery and recapture, for the Indian might turn his
head at any moment. There was but one course open to him.</p>

<p>“I must take the back track and try to get into the thicket
on the upper side of the village. That will be difficult, ’cos
the lodges above are nigh the river, and the Injuns may
diskiver me a-creepin’ along under the bank. It’s got to be
did, though.”</p>

<p>Just as the hunter came to the conclusion to try the desperate
chance for escape that was yet open to him, a great
black cloud came sailing over the face of the moon.</p>

<p>The silver rays hid by the cloud, darkness again vailed the
earth.</p>

<p>Boone could just distinguish the figure of the Indian before
him, and that was all.</p>

<p>“By hokey!” muttered the scout, in doubt, “I ought to be
able to skulk around that red heathen in this hyar darkness,
if it will only last!”</p>

<p>And then the old hunter looked searchingly at the heavens
above him.</p>

<p>The cloud was passing slowly along the darkened vault
above. In its track came another cloud fully as large and as
black as the first.</p>

<p>“I kin do it,” muttered Boone, decidedly. “I know I kin
do it; I kin get past that critter afore the moon shines out
ag’in. I’ll risk it, anyway. It will be a narrow shave, but a
miss is as good as a mile. So here goes.”</p>

<p>Slowly and cautiously, on his hands and knees, the daring
woodman crept forward.</p>

<p>He gained the level of the bank, and in his course commenced
to describe a semi-circle that would carry him wide
of the squatting chief and yet bring him to the bank of the
Scioto again.</p>

<p>Many an anxious glance the fugitive scout cast upward to
the sky as he proceeded on his way.</p>

<p>The cloud was still over the moon, but was rapidly growing
less and less dense, and the silver rays were beginning to
struggle feebly through it.</p>

<p>“By jingo!” muttered Boone, in dismay, although he still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
kept steadily on in his stealthy way, “that confounded moon
will be out, ’most as clear as daylight, in a minute. I shall
be in a worse fix than I was under the bank. I shall have to
lie still and hug the yearth. Then s’pose that heathen takes it
into his head to return to the center of the village, or any of
the other red devils comes to the river’s bank for water?
They’ll diskiver me, sure. Well, now, I am in a scrape!”</p>

<p>By this time the hunter had completed about half of the
semicircle, and was some hundred paces from the Indian. A
straight line drawn from the chief to the center of the village
would have touched Boone.</p>

<p>Suddenly, almost without warning, the cloud parted and
the moonbeams shone brightly over the earth.</p>

<p>Boone crouched to the ground, lying flat upon his face.
The back of the savage was toward him, so that, unless the
Indian turned around, he was in no danger of being discovered
for the present.</p>

<p>The breath of the scout came quick and hard.</p>

<p>Anxiously he looked up to the sky. The remainder of the
cloud had broken into fragments, and these, in passing over
the face of the “mistress of the night,” though somewhat
dimming the luster of her smile, yet did not hide the light
from the earth.</p>

<p>The second black cloud seemed, also, likely to break into
pieces like the first, thus destroying the hope that Boone had
of escaping from his present dangerous condition when its
mantle should hide the rays of the moon.</p>

<p>“Oh, ’tarnal death!” groaned Boone; “to come so fur, and
now to be stopped! If I could only get near enough to give
that pesky critter a clean dig—but what am I talking about?
I ain’t got any we’pon. The ’tarnal heathens took good
care of ’em for me. If this ain’t a fix, then I never was in
one.”</p>

<p>Boone looked upward to the heavens, but there could not
see any thing that seemed to favor his escape. Then his glance
wandered restlessly over the earth around him. He looked
to the Indian village; he could just distinguish the forms of
the warriors as they passed to and fro in the circle of light
thrown out by the blazing fires. Then he looked to the river,
and there sat the brawny Shawnee chief.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem! what’s that?” muttered Boone. His eyes
wandering to the river, caught sight of a dark mass extended
on the prairie, a few paces from where the savage sat. The
dark object was a little in the rear of the savage, and of
course was not in the range of his vision.</p>

<p>Boone was astonished.</p>

<p>“I’ll sw’ar!” he muttered, “that air heap of something
wasn’t thar when I looked afore.”</p>

<p>Boone bent a searching gaze upon it. The eyes of the
scout, trained from infancy to the life of the woods, were as
keen as the eyes of a hawk, yet he could make little of the
dark object that broke the level of the plain.</p>

<p>“It looks like a buffler-skin,” he said, after a long and careful
examination, “but the Injuns wouldn’t leave a hide lying
round loose like that; ’sides, I’m sure that it wasn’t thar
when I looked a moment ago. ’Tain’t likely that it could
have been thar and me not notice it.”</p>

<p>Then, to the utter astonishment of Boone, the dark object
moved. Little by little it seemed to creep nearer and nearer
to the savage, who sat so still in silent meditation.</p>

<p>The hunter rubbed his eyes; he could hardly believe that
he had seen aright. But a second look convinced him that
his eyes had not deceived him. The dark object that looked
so much like the skin of a buffalo had moved a dozen paces
or more toward the Shawnee chief.</p>

<p>A horrible suspicion seized upon Boone. For the first
time he guessed what the dark form was, and had a suspicion
regarding the silent stranger who had freed him from
the bonds that bound him in the Indian lodge.</p>

<p>Cold drops of perspiration stood upon the bronzed brow of
the old Indian-fighter.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem! to think that <em>thing</em> has had its paws on me,”
he muttered. “I ain’t afeard of any human that walks the
yearth, but this—well, it’s proved a good spirit to me, if it’s
a bad one to the red heathen.”</p>

<p>Slowly the dark form drew near to the savage. Unconscious
of danger, the chief sat silent and motionless as a
statue.</p>

<p>The Shawnee brave knew not that the dark angel was
nigh—that the dread scourge of his nation was about to add
him, another victim, to the long list of those who had fallen
as his prey.</p>

<p>“If my guess is right, thar’ll be a dead Injun round here
in about two minutes.”</p>

<p>Like one fascinated, Boone gazed upon the scene before
him with staring eyes.</p>

<p>The dark form had crept quite close to the savage. It was
now hardly a dozen paces from the chief.</p>

<p>A portion of the fleeting cloud passed over the moon; for
a single moment the silver light was vailed, and the mantle
of darkness cast over the earth.</p>

<p>Hardly had the gloom settled upon the plain, hiding the
form of the Indian and the dark, mysterious object that had
approached him so stealthily, from the gaze of the scout, when
a dull sound, like an ax cutting into a rotten tree, came from
the direction of the river; it was followed by a moan of pain.</p>

<p>Boone shivered when the noise fell upon his ears. He
guessed only too well what had transpired.</p>

<p>No other sound broke the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>The moon came forth again in its splendor. Again the
silver light flooded the prairie, and made the night like unto
the day.</p>

<p>Boone, with horror-stricken eyes, looked toward the river.</p>

<p>The Indian chief had disappeared.</p>

<p>Only a dark mass, motionless on the prairie, met the eyes
of the hunter.</p>

<p>Earnestly Boone swept his eyes along the horizon. No
form was in sight—bird, beast or human.</p>

<p>The scout felt his blood congeal within his veins with
horror.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand this,” he muttered, nervously; “I must see
what’s been goin’ on. If I ain’t wrong, my way to the wood
is clear now.”</p>

<p>Then Boone cast a rapid glance behind him in the direction
of the village. He saw nothing there to alarm him.</p>

<p>“Here goes,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Slowly and cautiously the old hunter crept near to the dark
form lying so still upon the prairie.</p>

<p>Some dozen paces from the shapeless mass the hunter
paused.</p>

<p>“By jingo!” he muttered, “I’m almost afear’d to look at
it, yet I’ve seen death a hundred times, but I never seen a
human killed by a demon before.”</p>

<p>Then again the hunter went on.</p>

<p>The rays of the moon were shining down full upon the
earth as Boone crept to the side of the silent form that paid
no heed to his approach.</p>

<p>The sight that met the wondering eyes of the scout was
strange indeed.</p>

<p>On the prairie, extended on his back, lay a stalwart Shawnee
chief.</p>

<p>His head was smoothly shaven, except where the eagle-plumes
twined in the scalp-lock.</p>

<p>The blood was gushing freely from a terrible wound in his
head.</p>

<p>An awful gash, the work of a muscular arm and a keen-edged
tomahawk, told of the manner of his death.</p>

<p>And on the naked breast of the savage were three lines of
blood.</p>

<p>The Red Arrow blazed there.</p>

<p>The Wolf Demon had marked his victim!</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">VIRGINIA’S GUIDE.</span></h2>


<p>Fruitless was the eager search of Murdock and Bob after
traces of the lost girl.</p>

<p>Giving it up at last as hopeless, the two returned to Point
Pleasant.</p>

<p>Alarmed at the long absence of his daughter and the young
stranger, the old General, with several of the best woodmen
of the station, had earnestly searched for her.</p>

<p>The party had penetrated into the ravine where Virginia
had been captured and the young man wounded.</p>

<p>The keen eyes of the woodmen quickly detected the marks
of blood upon the rocks where the stranger had fallen; then
they discovered the footprints of the attacking party. These
they followed till they led into the broad trail by the river.
There the scouts halted, baffled.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, General,” said Jake Jackson, who led the
scouts, shaking his head sagely. “The trail ends hyer.
Thar’s too many gone along this path for us to pick out our
men.”</p>

<p>“What is your opinion of the affair?” asked Treveling,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s just hyer,” said Jackson, slowly. “Your darter
and the young feller were in the ravine. They were attacked
by the three that we’ve been tracking. One on ’em
wounded—probably the young feller—and then both on ’em
carried away by the ones that attacked ’em, ’cos thar’s no
marks of their footsteps.”</p>

<p>“Think you that the attacking party were Indians?” asked
Treveling.</p>

<p>“Nary Injun!” responded Jackson, tersely. “They’re
white as I am.”</p>

<p>“What could be the motive of such a daring outrage?”
said the old General, whose heart was sorely tried by the loss
of his daughter.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to say, General,” said Jackson, dubiously, “unless
you’ve got some enemies, and this is the way they are
taking their revenge.”</p>

<p>“I can not understand it,” Treveling spoke, sorrowfully,
and his brow was heavy with grief. “If my Virginia is
lost, it is the second blow of the kind that has fallen upon
me.”</p>

<p>“The second?” said Jackson, in wonder.</p>

<p>“Yes; my eldest daughter, Augusta, was stolen from me
years ago. She wandered forth beyond the borders of the
settlement, one bright summer’s afternoon, and never returned.
Whether she was eaten up by the wild beasts that
roamed the forest, or fell beneath the tomahawks of the hostile
Indians, I never was able to discover. And now my
second daughter, all that I have left to me in this world, is
gone. My lot is hard to bear, indeed.”</p>

<p>The old man bent his head in agony. The rough woodmen
looked upon him with pity. Fathers themselves, they knew
how bitter were the feelings of the old man.</p>

<p>“Well, General, I don’t know what to do about this matter,”
said Jackson, thoughtfully. “I s’pose there’s nothin’ to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
be done just at present but to return to the station, and then
get up a party to search the country around thoroughly. It’s
bad that it happened just at this time, too, ’cos we’ve got an
Injun war on our hands, and we ain’t got any too many men
to fight the red devils; but I guess we kin spare a few to
help you out of this difficulty. I’ll go for one.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said another of the woodmen.</p>

<p>“And I, and I!” chimed in the rest of the little party.</p>

<p>And so it was settled that first they should return to the
station, make there all the needed preparations, and then set
out in search of the girl.</p>

<p>Silently and sorrowfully they took the trail leading to Point
Pleasant.</p>

<p>To return to Virginia.</p>

<p>Quietly she remained in the little log-cabin, waiting the return
of the stranger who had rescued her from the terrible
peril that she had been placed in.</p>

<p>Virginia had but little idea that she had escaped one danger
only to encounter another more terrible still.</p>

<p>Innocent and unsuspecting, she readily believed the words
of the stranger.</p>

<p>So patiently she waited in the lonely cabin for his return to
conduct her to Point Pleasant, and restore her once more to
the arms of her father.</p>

<p>One sad recollection was in Virginia’s memory—the untimely
death of the young stranger to whom she had freely
given all the best love of her girlish heart.</p>

<p>Sorrowfully she mourned for his death, as the memory of
his handsome face and frank, honest bearing came back to
her. He was the first and only man that she had ever
loved.</p>

<p>“Oh, my fate seems bitter, indeed!” she murmured. “Why
did Providence ever bring us together and implant the germs
of love in our hearts, if it was fated that we should be torn
apart thus rudely? I thought that we should be so happy together.
I looked forward to a bright and blissful future.
But now the past is full of dreadful memories, and the future
does not show one single ray of sunlight to brighten up the
darkness of my life.”</p>

<p>If Virginia’s thoughts were so dark and gloomy now, with
the prospect of being restored to her home and friends before
her, what would they have been had she known the truth?
Had she guessed that she was in the power of a man more
terrible and merciless in his nature than any red savage that
roamed the wild woods?</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, a mercy sometimes that we can not guess
the future.</p>

<p>Virginia had been in the lonely cabin some five hours,
wrapped in these gloomy thoughts. Then the man who had
called himself Benton stood again upon the edge of the clearing.</p>

<p>“So far, so good,” he muttered to himself, in joy, a smile
lighting up his dark face as he spoke. “Now to take the
bird from this cage and place it in one more secure; and
then, that task done, to visit my foe, let him know the vengeance
that has already fallen upon his head, and the more
terrible vengeance that is still to come. It has taken years
to ripen it, but the fruit will be bitter indeed.”</p>

<p>Then he crossed the little clearing and entered the cabin.</p>

<p>Virginia started up with joy as she saw who it was.</p>

<p>To her the dark-browed stranger was as a guardian angel—one
destined to protect and save her from the terrible
danger that menaced her.</p>

<p>“You have seen my father?” she cried, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And he is coming to save me?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Not coming?” and Virginia looked the surprise she felt.</p>

<p>“No; your father is quite sick, and unable to leave the
station.”</p>

<p>“My father ill?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the fearful anxiety that your unexplained absence
caused him came near resulting fatally; luckily, my timely
arrival with the news of your safety gave him hope, and
enabled him to fight against the illness that threatened his
life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my poor father!” murmured Virginia, sadly.</p>

<p>“Do not be alarmed. The danger is over now,” Benton
said. “I shall soon restore you to his arms, and your presence
will do him more good than all the medicine in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Then you will take me to him soon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, almost immediately.”</p>

<p>“Are my friends near at hand?” asked Virginia, looking
anxiously toward the door as she spoke, as though she expected
to see the stalwart form of Jackson, or some other
friend of her father, filling the doorway.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Will they be here soon, then?”</p>

<p>“Your father did not think that it was wise to send a small
party after you, and could not send a large one, as the settlement
is in danger of being attacked by the Indians at any
moment; so it was decided that it was best for me to return
alone and conduct you to Point Pleasant. The danger of two
being discovered by the savages is less than that attending a
large party. And if the Indians should discover us, no party
that could be spared from the settlement in this hour of peril
would be sufficient to withstand their attack.”</p>

<p>This appeared reasonable enough to Virginia.</p>

<p>“I am ready at any moment,” she said.</p>

<p>“We will set out at once, then,” Benton replied, moving to
the door as he spoke.</p>

<p>“The sooner the better,” Virginia cried, earnestly. “I
wish that I could fly like a bird to the side of my dear father.”</p>

<p>“We are not far from the station; it will be only a few
hours’ travel through the woods. A party from the settlement
will meet us at a place fixed upon by your father and
myself. If we can only reach that spot without being discovered
by the lurking savages, all will be well.”</p>

<p>“Let us hasten at once,” said Virginia, in a fever of impatience.</p>

<p>The blows of misfortune were falling thick and heavy upon
her head. First, her lover struck down lifeless at her feet;
then her capture by the hostile red-skins; and now the dangerous
illness of her only parent.</p>

<p>“Tread cautiously and lightly,” said Benton, in warning,
as they passed through the door of the cabin. “We can not
tell which bush or tree may conceal a lurking Indian. The
very leaves of the grass beneath our feet may hide a foe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will be very careful!” said Virginia, earnestly.</p>

<p>Then the two set out upon the dangerous journey.</p>

<p>Silently on through the wood they went.</p>

<p>After proceeding for a short time, Virginia began to wonder
at the manner in which the stranger led the way. A girl
reared on the border, she was somewhat familiar with border
ways.</p>

<p>What astonished her was that the man who was guiding
her was proceeding straight onward, apparently without caution
as if he had no fears of stumbling without warning upon
any red foes.</p>

<p>Virginia’s thought, however, was that he knew the path so
well, and had passed over it so recently, that he did not apprehend
danger.</p>

<p>Soon they came to a place where the bank stooped down
to meet the river. They had followed the Kanawha in their
course.</p>

<p>From the thicket that fringed the stream, the guide drew a
“dug-out,” and by its aid the two crossed the river. On the
opposite bank, Benton again concealed the “dug-out” in the
bushes.</p>

<p>And then again they proceeded on their way, following the
broad trail that led to Point Pleasant.</p>

<p>But in a half mile or so, Benton left the trail and struck
into the woods to the right of the path.</p>

<p>Virginia followed in wonder, for she knew well that they
had left the direct road to Point Pleasant and were going
away from, instead of approaching the station.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">IN THE TOILS.</span></h2>


<p>Although wondering at the path that the stranger was
pursuing, yet Virginia followed him for a short time in silence.</p>

<p>Deeper and deeper into the thicket went the stranger.</p>

<p>Virginia began to fear that he had mistaken the way. She
resolved to speak.</p>

<p>“Have you not made a mistake in the path?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, halting.</p>

<p>“But this is not the road leading to the settlement. We
should follow the trail running parallel with the river—the
trail we just left.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that that is the <em>direct</em> road,” he answered;
“but we are obliged to make a wide <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">detour</i> here to escape the
Shawnees. There is a large body of them ambushed by the
trail a short distance below here. We are to make a circle to
avoid them, and will come upon the trail again in due time.
Do not fear; I will guide you safely. I know these wilds
well. There is not a foot of ground between here and the
Ohio that is not as familiar to me as my own hand. It is
many years, though, since I have traversed these woods, but
I’ve a good memory and am not likely to go astray.”</p>

<p>“I feared that you might have made a mistake in the path,
therefore I spoke,” said Virginia, perfectly satisfied with the
stranger’s reasons.</p>

<p>On went the stranger again, and although he had imposed
caution on the girl, he did not seem to use much himself, for
he went straight onward as before, without seeming to fear
danger.</p>

<p>For a short time only did the guide continue in a straight
path, for soon he commenced a zigzag course; first to the
right, then to the left, then apparently he retraced the very
path that they had come; then turned abruptly to the right
again, went on a little way, then bent his course to the left.</p>

<p>Virginia was puzzled; she had been able before to tell the
way in which they had been proceeding; but now, after all
this turning and twisting, her brain was bewildered, and she
could not guess whether she was going straight to Point
Pleasant or in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>If the design of Benton had been to bother the girl by the
abrupt turns he had made, and to confuse her as to the direction
in which they were bending their steps, he had succeeded
admirably.</p>

<p>Virginia followed without a word. She was fully trusting
the man who was guiding her.</p>

<p>“We will soon be at the meeting-place appointed,” said
Benton, after an hour’s weary tramp through the almost
trackless wilderness.</p>

<p>“I am so glad,” replied the girl, “for I am getting sadly
tired.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will have rest enough, soon,” said Benton. And it
was well that Virginia did not see the dark smile that shone
on his features and lit up his evil eyes.</p>

<p>A few steps further on and the two came to a little glade in
the forest.</p>

<p>“This is the place,” said Benton, stopping in the center of
the glade.</p>

<p>Virginia looked around.</p>

<p>The dense forest surrounded them.</p>

<p>No sound broke the stillness of the virgin wood.</p>

<p>The quiet of the grave reigned within the forest glade.</p>

<p>“I do not see any one,” said Virginia; and, despite herself,
a feeling of apprehension stole over her.</p>

<p>The quiet of the forest seemed ominous of evil.</p>

<p>“They are near at hand,” said Benton, with a peculiar
smile.</p>

<p>For the first time, Virginia saw the evil look in his face.
His words, though apparently harmless, filled her with terror.</p>

<p>“Where are they?” she asked, a heavy weight upon her
heart as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Shall I call them?” Benton questioned, surveying the girl
with an air of triumph.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Virginia said, slowly.</p>

<p>With a mocking smile, Benton turned to where a dense
clump of bushes—an outpost of the thicket—had planted itself
upon the margin of the glade.</p>

<p>Virginia watched him with earnest eyes.</p>

<p>A dim presentiment of danger filled her soul.</p>

<p>Danger! yet what that danger was, she could not guess.</p>

<p>Two words came from the lips of the man who had acted
as Virginia’s guide.</p>

<p>Two words that struck a chill of horror to the heart of the
girl.</p>

<p>Yet the meaning of those two words she could not understand.</p>

<p>The two words were spoken in the Shawnee tongue.</p>

<p>Then forth from the thicket, in obedience to the summons,
came two dark and stalwart forms.</p>

<p>Life <em>was</em> in the forest, despite the gloom and silence!</p>

<p>One single glance Virginia gave, and then, with a cry of
mournful agony, she fell senseless to the ground.</p>

<p>The shock was too great to bear, and loss of consciousness
came like an earnest friend to drive away the terror that was
chilling the heart of the hapless maid.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And now we will return to the station at Point Pleasant.</p>

<p>The party who had been in search of the girl had returned.
They were to set forth again on the following morrow, to try
and discover, if it were possible, what had been the fate of
the General’s daughter.</p>

<p>Treveling himself, bowed down with agony, sought the
shelter of his dwelling.</p>

<p>The old man’s heart was heavy with woe.</p>

<p>The twilight had come. Treveling, busy in thought, had
not noticed the coming darkness, when he was suddenly
aroused from his abstraction by the abrupt entrance of a
stranger.</p>

<p>Treveling looked at his visitor in astonishment.</p>

<p>The man was a stranger to him. He was a muscular fellow,
habited in the usual border fashion of deer-skin.</p>

<p>“You are General Treveling?” the stranger asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the old man, “that is my name.”</p>

<p>“My name is James Benton; I am a stranger in these parts,
though some years ago I resided hereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Your face seems familiar to me,” replied Treveling, with
a puzzled air, “yet I can not remember to have ever known
a man who bore the name you give.”</p>

<p>“Your memory may be at fault,” said the stranger, coldly.</p>

<p>“It is rarely so, but still it may be as you say,” replied the
General, who felt sure that he had seen the stranger’s face
before.</p>

<p>“You and I, General, are old acquaintances,” said Benton.</p>

<p>“We are?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It is very strange then that I can not remember your
name—I mean, that it does not seem familiar to me.”</p>

<p>“A man’s face is more easily remembered than his name.”</p>

<p>“That is very true,” replied Treveling. “At what time in
the past did I ever meet you?”</p>

<p>“Do you remember Lewis’ expedition in Dunmore’s time?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When he whipped Corn-planter at the head of the Shawnees,
Mingoes and Wyandots in the Battle of Point Pleasant?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” again replied the old man; “I commanded a division
under Lewis in that fight.”</p>

<p>“No one knows that better than myself,” said the stranger,
with a peculiar smile. “I served under you.”</p>

<p>“Ah, were you in the battle of Point Pleasant?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“How was that?” asked Treveling, in astonishment; “my
division was in the hottest of the fight.”</p>

<p>“I left your command <em>before</em> the battle took place.”</p>

<p>“It is strange that I do not remember of ever hearing your
name before, but your face certainly is familiar. Well, sir,
as an old comrade in arms, I am glad to meet you. You are
welcome, sir, to make my house your home while you remain
at the station. I can give you an old Virginia welcome,
though I am afraid that I can not play the part of the host so
well as I ought to, for I am suffering now, sir, under an affliction
that has sorely tried me.” And the old soldier heaved a
deep sigh as he spoke.</p>

<p>“You refer to the loss of your daughter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“It is a heavy blow.”</p>

<p>“Ah! none but a father’s heart can feel how heavy such a
blow is. She was my only child, sir; the pride of my old
age, and now she is taken from me. I am but an old and
withered oak; the support and love that bound me to earth
is gone, and I care not how soon I receive the summons that
bids me appear before the Great Commander above!” The
tone in which the old man spoke would have touched almost
any heart and made it sympathize with his sorrow. But, the
heart of the dark-faced stranger only thrilled with fierce joy
as he listened to the words of the old man.</p>

<p>“Your only child, I think you said?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Treveling, in wonder, “my only child!”</p>

<p>“How is that? If my memory does not deceive me, in
the old time, when I served under you, you had <em>two</em> daughters.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right,” replied Treveling, “but the elder of
the two, my bright-eyed Augusta, strayed into the woods one
day and never came back. She was but a child then;
and now the other, my Virginia, she, too, is gone, and in the
self-same manner as her sister. That is what makes the blow
more terrible.”</p>

<p>“You never discovered any traces of the first?”</p>

<p>“No,” Treveling answered, sadly.</p>

<p>“And now no traces of the second?”</p>

<p>“You speak only the cruel truth.”</p>

<p>“Cheer up, General; I bring you news of your second
daughter!”</p>

<p>“You do?” cried the old man, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes; by chance I discovered something in the forest that
revealed to me her fate.”</p>

<p>“Only give me some clue by which I may find my child
and I will go down on my knees and bless you, sir!” exclaimed
the old soldier, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Put on your hat and walk with me a short distance.
The moon is bright, and I will tell you all I have discovered.
It is a terrible affair, and I fear to speak within walls.”</p>

<p>Eagerly Treveling followed Benton from the house.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">CALLING BACK THE PAST.</span></h2>


<p>As Treveling followed the stranger from the cabin he marveled,
somewhat, at the odd place chosen by the man, who
had called himself Benton, for an interview. But urged onward
by the anxious father’s heart that beat within his
breast, he followed his guide without fear.</p>

<p>Benton led the way through the station, passed the stockade
and reached the forest beyond. He followed the trail
leading up the Kanawha.</p>

<p>On, through the shadows cast by the tree-tops, the two
went.</p>

<p>A good half-mile from the stockade, in a little spot of clear
ground, where the flickering light of the moonbeams danced
in fantastic rays, Benton halted.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, as he wheeled abruptly round and faced
the old soldier, “this will do; just the spot for an interview.”</p>

<p>The General wondered at the words of the stranger; wondered
still more at the peculiar expression that was on his
face.</p>

<p>“Do you remember this spot, General?” asked Benton.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Treveling, after a glance around him.</p>

<p>“And yet you have been here before.”</p>

<p>“That is very likely, but there is nothing in particular that
I can remember to fix the spot in my mind,” Treveling said.</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“Quite sure.” The old General could not understand the
meaning of these odd questions in relation to a simple opening
in the forest.</p>

<p>“And yet something happened in this very spot that should
have fixed it forever in your memory.”</p>

<p>“I can not remember,” said Treveling, puzzled.</p>

<p>“You were an officer under Lewis when he fought the
battle of Point Pleasant and whipped Corn-planter in Dunmore’s
time?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you spoke of this before; you said that you
served under me in that fight.”</p>

<p>“No, not in the fight, but before it,” said the stranger.
“When I call back the memory of that campaign, do you not
remember some event that happened in this very glade?”</p>

<p>“No,” Treveling answered, after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p>“You do not?” Benton said, with astonishment.</p>

<p>“No,” Treveling again replied.</p>

<p>“Let me call back to your mind a scene or two that happened
long years ago.”</p>

<p>There was an icy tone in the voice of the stranger that
struck a sudden chill to the heart of the old man. For the
first time he felt a feeling of apprehension regarding the man
who was acting so strangely.</p>

<p>“Dunmore is Governor of Virginia,” commenced the
stranger, “and General Lewis is marching with all the force
that can be raised along the border, against Corn-planter at
the head of the Shawnees, the Mingoes and the Wyandots.
He has halted here, information having reached the ears of
the General that the Indians, in great numbers, are at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
junction of the Kanawha and the Ohio, ready to give him
battle.”</p>

<p>As the stranger spoke, Treveling, with a bewildered air,
was gazing around him. Slowly, little by little, the memory
of the past came back to him.</p>

<p>The little glade now seemed familiar to his eyes. It had
been the camping-ground of his own regiment.</p>

<p>“I do remember now!” he exclaimed. “Here I encamped
the day before the fight. The glade has changed somewhat,
though, since that time. Then, instead of this broad trail,
there was naught but an Indian foot-path here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is some years since Lewis’ army eat their hog and
hominy under the forest boughs that shadow in this little
glade.”</p>

<p>“Why do you recall Lewis’ campaign?” asked Treveling.</p>

<p>“Wait a little and you shall learn,” said Benton, and an
ominous light shone in his eyes as he spoke. “Here Lewis’
army halted to prepare for the deadly fight that they expected
would come on the morrow. In this little opening your division
was encamped. Your men had hardly laid aside their
arms and begun to prepare their supper, when a blow was
given and received. You, the colonel in command, were
struck in the face and felled to the earth by a private soldier
to whom you had given the lie.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember the circumstance now that you call it
to my memory, although I had forgotten it long since,” said
Treveling, calmly.</p>

<p>“The man who struck you was a volunteer; a man known
far and wide as one of the best scouts in all the Ohio valley.
He did not think for a moment that you wore the golden
marks of a colonel on your shoulders while his were covered
only by the buck-skin hunting-shirt of the borderer. You insulted
him, and he struck you to his feet as any man would
have done.”</p>

<p>“But, on the following morning, he paid dearly for that
blow,” said Treveling, quickly.</p>

<p>“You never spoke a truer word,” returned Benton, bitterly.
“When the morning came, the same waving boughs that witnessed
you give the lie to the scout, and then saw you kiss
the dust, stricken there by his arm, looked down upon the
drum-head court-martial. And then beheld the lash cut long
welts of blood on the naked shoulders of the borderer, who
had dared to forget that he was a soldier and remember that
he was a man. And then, degraded, a whipped slave, he was
driven forth a dishonored wretch.”</p>

<p>“All this happened years ago; why do you recall it?”
asked Treveling, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I recall the past that I may speak of the present,” replied
Benton, a sullen frown upon his face and anger flaming in his
eyes. “Did you ever learn the fate of the man whose life
you ruined?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Treveling.</p>

<p>“Do you remember what he said to you, after the lash had
done its work and they raised the almost helpless man, crimsoned
with his own blood?”</p>

<p>“No, except that it was a threat of some sort.”</p>

<p>“He said ‘your quarters shall swim in blood for this,’ and
he kept his word. The man whose back was torn by your
lash, joined the red-men, became a white Indian, a renegade
to his country and his kin. He swore bitter and eternal vengeance
against you, and he kept his oath. When your cabin
by the Ohio was attacked, he headed the Shawnees. You escaped
only by a miracle. Then, when you had taken refuge
in the station of Point Pleasant, he thought of another plan
to be revenged upon you. You had two daughters once.”
The stranger paused. There was a fearful meaning in his
simple words.</p>

<p>“Can it be possible that this human fiend can have had
aught to do with the unaccountable disappearance of my
eldest child, Augusta?” cried Treveling, in breathless anxiety.</p>

<p>“She wandered forth one summer’s day within the woods
and never came back?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” exclaimed the anxious father; “can you tell
me aught of her fate?”</p>

<p>“I can,” replied Benton, with a look of fearful meaning.
“In the wood, like a hawk on the watch, was the man who
had sworn such deadly vengeance upon your head. His heart
leaped for joy when he beheld the prattling child enter the
shadows of the forest. He seized the little girl, your eldest
joy, and carried her from the station. In the gloomy recesses
of the forest he left her to die.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the heartless fiend!” cried the father, in agony.</p>

<p>“And think you that even this glorious vengeance satisfied
him? No! He panted for more. Thirsted for it as the hungry
wolf thirsts for blood to satisfy the cravings of its savage nature.
You still had another daughter left. For years this
human bloodhound hung about the station eager to rob you
of the sole remaining joy that made your life happy. Time
passed on; your daughter grew to womanhood, as fair a
flower as ever bloomed on the banks of the Ohio. Patiently
your foe waited. Chance at last gave the golden opportunity,
and your daughter fell into his hands.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried the old man, horror-stricken and hardly
able to believe the evidence of his senses.</p>

<p>“Your daughter is now a prisoner in his hands. A captive,
helpless, in the Shawnee nation.”</p>

<p>“But is there no way to release her?” cried Treveling,
in anguish. “I will pay any sum possible for me to procure.”</p>

<p>“If you could turn every drop of your blood into a golden
guinea and spill them one by one from your veins your foe
would laugh at you and bid you remember the hour when
in this very glade you scarred his back with a lash,” replied
Benton, fiercely.</p>

<p>“This man is a demon to seek such a vengeance!” cried
Treveling, in despair.</p>

<p>“You are right, he is a demon,” replied Benton, bitterly.
“Can you wonder at it? Is he not an outcast from all that
makes life dear, a savage amid savages?”</p>

<p>“Is there no way to touch this man’s heart?”</p>

<p>“He has no heart; in its place is a lump of red clay; is he
not a white Indian? What has such as he to do with hearts?”</p>

<p>“Why did not this man strike at my life, if he bears me the
hatred that you say he does?”</p>

<p>“Death is not the most cruel vengeance,” returned Benton,
scornfully. “Can bodily pain cause you greater anguish than
that you now suffer?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” replied Treveling, slowly.</p>

<p>“He would have you live. Would have you know of the
terrible vengeance that he has pulled down upon your head.
Can you guess what the fate of your daughter will be?”</p>

<p>A shudder shook the frame of the old man as the question
fell upon his ears.</p>

<p>“Oh, the thought is terrible!” he moaned.</p>

<p>“A young and pretty white girl in the Shawnee village
will not lack for admirers. Your foe will give her to some
brawny red chief to be his slave. A helpless prisoner, the
victim of the savages, she will pine away and die. Her death
will be a terrible one, for she will die by inches. You now
know the fate of both your children. One has already suffered
for your acts long years ago, and the other is now paying
the penalty.”</p>

<p>The stranger turned upon his heel as if to depart.</p>

<p>“Stay!” cried Treveling; “who are you that know all
these horrible things?”</p>

<p>“Have you not already guessed?” asked Benton, with a
smile of terrible meaning. “If my shoulders were bare, you
could tell who I am, for the marks of the lash are still there.
If you would know my name, a week hence ask the blazing
dwellings along the Ohio that mark the track of the Shawnees;
the glowing embers and hissing flames will answer,
Simon Girty, the renegade.”</p>

<p>Then, with a bound, Girty disappeared in the forest.</p>

<p>Sick at heart, Treveling returned to the station.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">BOONE’S ESCAPE.</span></h2>


<p>Almost speechless with horror, the old hunter bent over
the body of the murdered Indian.</p>

<p>“One clean cut settled him,” the borderer muttered, as his
eyes fell upon the terrible gash on the head of the red chief,
and from which the red life-blood was slowly ebbing. “I’ve
seen it; thar’s no mistake. It’s either the devil or a near
relation. I owe him something, though, for he’s got me out
of the tightest place that this old carcass has been in for many
a long day.”</p>

<p>Then the scout cast a stealthy glance around him. The
clouds pushing over the moon still vailed the earth with darkness.</p>

<p>“I must git out of this hyer, quick, ef not quicker. I
won’t give the red heathen another chance at my top-knot ef
I kin help it. I wonder whar Kenton and Lark are? I
s’pose they must be nigh the village, somewhar. Well, I’ve
found out all that I wanted to know. The Injuns mean mischief—they’re
mean enough for any thing—and Point Pleasant
will receive the first blow. Now, I’d better be makin’
tracks for the settlement. Jerusalem! I hope I won’t meet
that awful <em>thing</em> in the wood. Why, my very blood freezes
when I think of it.” And the stout borderer shuddered as
he spoke. Back to his mind came the likeness of the dark
form that had freed him from his bonds in the Indian village;
again he felt on his person the light touch of the hairy arm
that bore such terrible nails.</p>

<p>“I ain’t afeard of any thing human, but I ain’t used to the
critters from the other world. Now, to gain the shelter of
the forest and then to carry the tidings of this attack to the
settlement.”</p>

<p>Carefully the old scout proceeded on his dangerous path.</p>

<p>Leaving the dead Indian where he had fallen, Boone again
sought the shelter of the river’s bank.</p>

<p>Fortune favored the adventurer. No hostile Indian barred
his way. Unobserved he reached the friendly shadows cast
by the forest monarchs.</p>

<p>On the borders of the wood Boone halted for a moment
and looked back on the Indian village, that nestled so peacefully
by the bank of the rolling Scioto, bathed in the soft
moonlight.</p>

<p>“Who could guess that yonder village contained a thousand
red-skins thirsting for blood and slaughter?” exclaimed
the old hunter, communing with himself; his gaze resting
upon the quiet scene before him. The embers of the fires
cast a crimson light on the wigwams and played in fantastic
shadows along the plain.</p>

<p>“I’d better be moving,” muttered Boone; “first for the
hollow oak; there I’ll probably meet Lark and Kenton. I’ll
bet a big drink of corn-juice that nary one on ’em has been
as fur into the Injun village as I have. I reckon I’m not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
over anxious to risk it ag’in. How the red devils would have
danced around me ef they only got the opportunity to roast
me a little.” And the old hunter chuckled at the thought.
Yet even now he was far from being out of danger, but he
thought not of it. In the forest, free, he thought himself a
match for all the Shawnee nation.</p>

<p>With noiseless steps the hunter took his way through the
wood.</p>

<p>Quickly, but carefully, he went onward. Not a stick cracked
beneath his tread. A fox, intent on prey, could hardly have
proceeded more noiselessly.</p>

<p>As the shadows of the forest deepened around the path of
the woodman, he glanced nervously from side to side as if
he expected that some hostile form would spring upon him
from the darkness of the thicket; and yet it was no red warrior
that he expected to see, no brawny chief, decked with
the war-paint and wearing the moccasins of the Shawnee.
No, the form he expected was that of a huge gray wolf that
walked erect like a man, and carried in his paw the tomahawk
of the Indian. A form more terrible than any feathered,
tinctured chief; more to be dreaded than any red-skin who
claimed the Ohio valley as his own.</p>

<p>On went the hunter, still glaring about him in the darkness;
but the terrible Wolf Demon sprung not from the
covert of the wood. If he lurked about the pathway of the
scout, he kept himself concealed within the fastness of the
forest.</p>

<p>Boone reached the hollow oak without seeing aught to
make him apprehend danger. The forest was as quiet as if
no deed of blood had ever occurred within its bounds. As
silent as though the terrible form—the demon of the Indian
and the phantom of the white—had never stricken unto
death and sent to his long home the stout-limbed Shawnee
warrior.</p>

<p>“Hullo! thar’s no one about,” Boone muttered, as he peered
within the hollow of the oak.</p>

<p>“Boone!” cried a voice, low and cautiously from the thicket
that fringed the little glade wherein stood the oak.</p>

<p>Then from the darkness, into the circle of light cast by the
moonbeams, stepped Kenton.</p>

<p>“Top-knot all right, eh?” questioned Boone, clasping the
hand of the other warmly within his own broad palm.</p>

<p>“Yes, but how long it will be all right is a riddle. The
Injuns are ’round us thick as bees ’round a honeycomb.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ve seen the red heathen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I scouted in right to the Injun village. But, as I
lay in ambush, there was an awful row kicked up and I was
afeard of being caught in a trap by the Injuns, so I jist retreated
to safer quarters.”</p>

<p>“A row, eh?” said Boone, smiling.</p>

<p>“Yes, a ’tarnal row; they just kicked up Old Scratch for
a little while. I reckon it must have been a fight among the
Shawnees,” Kenton replied.</p>

<p>“You’re right, Simon; it were a fight, and in that fight I
was captivated.”</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t say so?” said Kenton, in wonder.</p>

<p>“Gospel truth,” replied Boone. “I scouted into the village,
and camped down behind a log just as quiet as a mouse,
and—would you believe it?—a squaw and her lover came and
squatted down right onto the very log ahind which I lay!
Then the Injun tried to kiss the gal, she wouldn’t let him,
and the end of it was that both of ’em tumbled over on me,
ker-chunk. I had a lively tussle with the heathen, but the
other red devils came up, and thar were too many of ’em for
me, and the end was that they took me into one of the wigwams,
bound hand and foot.”</p>

<p>“But how did you manage to escape?” asked Kenton, in
wonder.</p>

<p>“Well, now I’m going to tell you something that will
make you open your eyes,” said Boone, impressively, and
with an air of great mystery. “Mind you, I wouldn’t have
believed this, if I hadn’t seen it. Ke-ne-ha-ha came to me in
the wigwam and wanted me to become a white Injun. To
gain time I asked till the morning to think over the matter.
The chief consented and left me. Then, as I lay bound and
helpless in the lodge, the fire burnt down so that I could
hardly see, something cut a hole through the side of the wigwam
and came in. I could just make out that it was a great
black form, all muffled up in blankets. I knew that it was
blankets, for a little while arter I had a chance to feel ’em.
Well, this thing was a good deal bigger than I am—and thar
ain’t many men in the Ohio valley that out-top me. This
dark form cut the thongs that bound my legs and arms, gave
me a blanket, and I followed it from the wigwam. Outside
of the lodge this thing, that saved me, either went down into
the earth or up into the air, for it vanished just like smoke
disappears.”</p>

<p>Kenton listened with wonder to the strange tale.</p>

<p>“Then I sneaked along under the bank of the river, making
my way to the cover of the wood,” continued Boone, “till I
came to the hoss-path leading to the river, and thar in the
path sat a cussed Shawnee. But as the moon was under a
cloud, I thought I’d try to sneak round him on the prairie
above. Just as I got about half-way, the moon came out
ag’in and I hugged the yearth mighty close, I tell yer. Then
I see’d a dark object a-creepin’ nigh to the Injun. A cloud
came over the moon for a minute, so that I couldn’t see; but
I heard a groan, though, and the sound of a blow. When
the moon came out ag’in, the dark form had disappeared,
and the Injun had been killed by a single tomahawk-dig in
the skull, and on the breast of the chief were three knife-slashes,
making a Red Arrow.”</p>

<p>“The Wolf Demon, by hokey!” cried Kenton, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“You’re right; but what on yearth is the critter?” said
Boone, solemnly.</p>

<p>“I reckon it’s the devil,” replied Kenton, with a sober face.</p>

<p>“Well, devil or not, it saved me from the hands of the
Shawnees,” said Boone. “The Injuns meant to roast me in
the morning. But if this thing is the devil, thar’s some substance
to it, ’cos I felt its arm, and it’s as hairy as a bear-skin.
Besides, it’s got claws.”</p>

<p>“Of course; it’s the devil in the shape of a wolf.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but why should he trouble himself to save me from
the Shawnees?” asked Boone.</p>

<p>“Well, thar’s whar you’ve got me,” replied Kenton, scratching
his head, reflectively.</p>

<p>“He’s death on the Injuns, anyway,” said Boone. “Why,
the feller he killed so easy would have given any man a hard
tussle, ef he had half a chance.”</p>

<p>“It’s plain that he don’t want white blood, ’cos he wouldn’t
have saved you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true. I don’t wonder that the red-skins are
afeard of him; why, it makes my blood fairly run cold when
I think about it.” And the sober look of the old scout told
plainly that he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Lark?” asked Kenton, suddenly.</p>

<p>“No, hain’t he come back?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you seen him since we parted here?”</p>

<p>“No; have you?”</p>

<p>“Nary time,” Boone replied, laconically.</p>

<p>“Can he have been captivated by the Shawnees?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not likely,” Boone replied. “Ef he had been, I
should have heard something of it. The Injuns would have
been tickled to death to have been able to have told me that
there was another white man to be burnt at my side for their
amusement.”</p>

<p>“Did you learn anything about the attack?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all about it. The blow will fall on Point Pleasant
first. Thar’ll be such a blaze along the Ohio that the smoke
will almost hide the sun. Let’s go into the hollow of the
oak, wait for Lark, and while we are waiting, I’ll tell you all
about it.” Then the two sought shelter within the hollow
tree.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">KE-NE-HA-HA AND THE MEDICINE-MAN.</span></h2>


<p>The great chief of the Shawnee nation, Ke-ne-ha-ha, “The-man-that-walks,”
was pacing slowly to and fro before the door
of his wigwam, which was situated in the center of the village.</p>

<p>A cloud was upon the brow of the chief as he paced moodily
up and down.</p>

<p>The moonbeams shone upon his stalwart form and glistened
in sparkling rays of silvery light upon the blade of the keen-edged
scalping-knife thrust so carelessly through the girdle
that spanned his sinewy waist.</p>

<p>Care was on the brow and anxiety in the face of the Shawnee
chieftain.</p>

<p>His thoughts were of the dreaded Wolf Demon—the terrible
scourge that was laying his heavy hand so cruelly upon
the warriors of his tribe.</p>

<p>The Shawnee chief had the heart of a lion. No face had
ever yet made him turn upon his heel. A thousand bullets
had whistled in waked wrath around his head and he had
faced the storm undauntedly. The glittering knife of the
hostile foe had sought his heart, and even as the point tore his
flesh, he had grimly smiled and stricken his enemy to the earth.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha feared not mortal man, but now his foe was a
fiend from the other world, and the stout-hearted Shawnee
chief trembled when he thought of the terrible foe who struck
so silently and yet so fearfully.</p>

<p>He would have given all the fame he had acquired on the
war-path, all the honor that he had won in the council-chamber,
to be put face to face with the demon of his race, so
that he might discover who and what the terrible creature was.</p>

<p>At a little distance from the chief stood two of the principal
warriors of the nation. One was called the Black Cloud,
the other, Noc-a-tah.</p>

<p>“A cloud is on the brow of the chief,” said Noc-a-tah, as
he watched Ke-ne-ha-ha pacing to and fro, with all the restless,
springy motion of the imprisoned tiger.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the other. “Ke-ne-ha-ha has not smiled
since the death of the Red Arrow. She was his eldest daughter
and the singing-bird that gladdened his wigwam with her
song. The heart of the chief is sad—many moons have passed
away, but he can not forget the child that he loved so well.”</p>

<p>“Let the chief steep his memory in the blood of the so-cursed
white-skins and then he will forget the wrong that
they have done him.”</p>

<p>“The chief speaks with a straight tongue,” said Black Cloud,
sagely. “When Ke-ne-ha-ha goes on the war-path he will
forget. The sight of this blood and the smoke of their burning
dwellings will clear the cloud of sorrow from his brain.
Then he will laugh, for he can show the world how the
great chief of the Shawnees wipes out the memory of his
wrongs.”</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha approaching, the two warriors put a stop to
their conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“The white prisoner is securely guarded?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the Black Cloud, “three warriors guard the
lodge of the pale-face.”</p>

<p>For a moment Ke-ne-ha-ha was silent, apparently lost in
thought; then suddenly he spoke again.</p>

<p>“The mind of the chief is not easy—there is a load upon it—as
heavy as the house the turtle carries upon his back.”</p>

<p>“What troubles the mind of the great chief of the Shawnee
nation?” asked Noc-a-tah, respectfully.</p>

<p>“The chief can not tell—the shadows come upon his heart
like the clouds over the moon, without warning, without reason.
Ke-ne-ha-ha fears for the safety of the white prisoner;
he would rather lose one of his ears than have the white foe
escape. Let my warriors go with me. We will see the pale-face.”</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha, followed by the two chiefs, sought the lodge
where Boone was confined.</p>

<p>As the Indian had said, three braves guarded the door.</p>

<p>In answer to Ke-ne-ha-ha’s question they replied that all
had been still as death within the wigwam of the prisoner.</p>

<p>Feeling reassured, Ke-ne-ha-ha was about to return to his
own wigwam, when a sudden fancy took possession of him
to see the white captive and so personally assure himself of
the safety of the prisoner.</p>

<p>Taking a brand from the smoldering fire, the chief entered
the lodge. The other warriors remained outside.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha’s tall form had hardly disappeared within the
hut, when a cry of surprise broke upon the Indians’ startled
ears. It came from the lodge and was uttered by the lips of
Ke-ne-ha-ha.</p>

<p>Astonished, the Indians rushed into the lodge.</p>

<p>In the center of the wigwam stood the chief.</p>

<p>The lodge was dimly lighted by the burning brand that he
carried in his hand.</p>

<p>The prisoner had disappeared.</p>

<p>Great was the astonishment and anger of the Indians.</p>

<p>Soon they discovered the slit in the side of the lodge where
the keen-edged knife had opened a passage to the air.</p>

<p>The savages were utterly astounded. Boone had been carefully
and thoroughly searched; all his weapons taken from
him, and yet it was plain that he had contrived to free himself
from his bonds and cut his way out of the lodge.</p>

<p>A moment’s examination, however, convinced Ke-ne-ha-ha
that the bonds that had bound the hunter had been cut by
some other hand than his own.</p>

<p>Then the Indians passed through the hole cut in the wigwam,
and outside in the soft earth searched for traces of the
prisoner’s footsteps.</p>

<p>These they soon found.</p>

<p>The soft earth of the bank of the river was as yielding as
wax, and by the clear light of the moonbeams the Indians discovered
the mark of two different footprints. The first they
came to was evidently made by the broad moccasin of Boone;
but the second was a puzzle. It was also the print of a moccasin,
but the toes turned inward like the footprint of an Indian.</p>

<p>“The pale-face had some white-hearted Indian, lurking like
a snake within the thicket, who has aided him to escape,”
said Ke-ne-ha-ha, in anger.</p>

<p>A cry of wonder from the Black Cloud attracted the attention
of all.</p>

<p>The chief, a little ahead of the rest of the party, had been
examining the bank of the river, which, there, from the level
of the stream, was about as high as a man’s waist.</p>

<p>The others hurried to the side of the Black Cloud, drawn
thither by his exclamation.</p>

<p>With wondering eyes the chief was gazing upon some
marks on the soft clay bank.</p>

<p>And when the eyes of the other looked upon the strange
mark, they wondered, too.</p>

<p>On the soft clay was imprinted an animal’s paw.</p>

<p>The impression was perfect; claws, all were there, and the
keen-eyed chief, Noc-a-tah, picked out a short, gray hair that
had remained stuck in the clay.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha’s brow grew dark when he looked upon the
strange impression.</p>

<p>“It is the mark of a wolf’s paw,” said the Black Cloud, astonished.</p>

<p>“Yes, and here is one of the hairs of the beast. It is a
gray wolf,” observed Noc-a-tah.</p>

<p>“Let my warriors look further on, they may find more
traces,” said Ke-ne-ha-ha, gravely.</p>

<p>The warriors obeyed the instruction.</p>

<p>In the center of the horse-path, cold and dead, they found
the Shawnee chief.</p>

<p>On the breast of the slain warrior blazed the fearful token,
the Red Arrow.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha then knew only too well who it was that had
rescued the white hunter from his power, and left the footprint
of an Indian and the mark of a wolf’s paw as traces behind
him. The terrible Wolf Demon had again been in the
midst of the Shawnee village. Again had his powerful arm
struck the fearful blow that sealed the death of a red warrior.</p>

<p>Mournfully the Indians carried the body of the slain man
to his wigwam, and soon the wail of lamentation and despair
broke on the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>“What does the chief think?” asked the Black Cloud, as
he watched the lowering face of Ke-ne-ha-ha.</p>

<p>“That the Bad Spirit is among us,” returned the chief,
slowly. “My warriors are falling, one by one, by the hand
of this secret foe. I would give my own life to conquer him
and save my nation from him.”</p>

<p>“Why not seek the Medicine Man? The Wolf Demon is
a spirit—the Medicine Man will give the chief a charm so
that he can fight the Wolf Demon,” said the Black Cloud,
sagely.</p>

<p>“My brother speaks well—his counsel is good—the chief
will visit the Great Medicine,” replied Ke-ne-ha-ha.</p>

<p>And acting instantly on the resolution that he had formed,
Ke-ne-ha-ha went at once to the wigwam of the old Indian
who was the Great Medicine Man of the Shawnee tribe.</p>

<p>The wigwam of the Great Medicine was far from the others
of the village, and half hid itself within the borders of the
wood as if it courted solitude.</p>

<p>The Great Medicine of the Shawnees was an aged man.
Infirm and old was he, yet gifted with wondrous skill. He
knew all the properties of the herbs of the forest, the meadow
and the swamp. Could cure by charms and conjurations the
most dangerous diseases.</p>

<p>The savages looked upon him with awe and wonder. Even
Ke-ne-ha-ha, the great chief as he was of the Shawnee nation,
felt a slight sensation of fear creep over him as he entered
the wigwam of the Great Medicine.</p>

<p>As usual the Medicine Man sat in a corner of the lodge all
wrapped up in blankets, even his head concealed. Only his
face was visible, and that painted in streaks of black and
white in a horrible fashion.</p>

<p>A little fire burning in the center of the lodge cast a dim
light over the scene.</p>

<p>The Medicine Man made a slight motion with his head as
the chief entered, as if to acknowledge his presence.</p>

<p>“Let the Great Medicine open his ears while the chief of
the Shawnee speaks, and let his words sink into his heart as
the soft summer rain sinks into the earth.”</p>

<p>Another slight motion of the head answered the words of
the chief.</p>

<p>“It is good—let my brother listen,” said the chief, gravely.</p>

<p>Again the Medicine Man bowed his head.</p>

<p>“The Shawnees are a great nation—many warriors—brave
as the panther—cunning as the fox. The Shawnee braves
fear not death, but they wish to meet it face to face. Now
it crawls upon them from behind—in the darkness, and strikes
them to death before they dream that a foe is near. Can my
father tell me of a charm to conquer the Wolf Demon?”</p>

<p>“Does the chief wish to see him?” asked the Great Medicine,
in a cracked and wavering voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the chief, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I will bring the Wolf Demon before him at once.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">ON THE TRAIL.</span></h2>


<p>Virginia woke from her swoon to find herself a captive in
the hands of the Shawnees.</p>

<p>Three grim and painted chiefs were her guards.</p>

<p>Virginia shuddered when she thought of the terrible fate
that was in store for her. No ray of light broke through the
darkness of the clouded future. She despaired of ever again
seeing home and friends.</p>

<p>The red-men bore her swiftly through the forest, heading
toward the Ohio.</p>

<p>The false white man, the treacherous guide, who had led her
into the snare, had disappeared.</p>

<p>Crossing the Ohio, the savages conducted their prisoner to
the Indian village at Chillicothe.</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing among the Shawnees, when the
hapless girl was brought a prisoner into their midst. It
seemed to them like an omen of good fortune.</p>

<p>Virginia was placed in one of the wigwams, and there left
in solitude to meditate upon the dreadful misfortune that had
come upon her.</p>

<p>Alone, far from home and kindred, there seemed no avenue
of escape open to her. Despairing, she prayed to the Great
Power above to rescue her from her terrible peril.</p>

<p>Leaving the despairing maid to her own sad thoughts, we
will return to the renegade Girty.</p>

<p>After leaving the old General, Girty made his way to the
secluded glade in the forest where he had arranged to meet
Kendrick.</p>

<p>Girty found his companion waiting for him.</p>

<p>“The Indians have departed with the girl?” Girty asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; by the way, what do you intend to do with her?”
said Kendrick.</p>

<p>“Give her to some chief for a wife. I have just had a little
talk with Treveling. I told him who I was and of the vengeance
that I have taken for the wrong that he did me so
many years ago.” Girty’s face showed plainly his fierce joy
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“It was a dangerous attempt to penetrate into yonder
settlement,” said Kendrick.</p>

<p>“Yes, but my disguise, you see, is perfect. This black wig
covers my own hair, and the walnut stain upon my face
changes the color of my complexion. But we must return to
Chillicothe. The settlers know of Ke-ne-ha-ha’s intended attack
and are prepared for it. The chief must know it. The
design to surprise the station has failed.”</p>

<p>“Will he then give up the attack?”</p>

<p>“No; Ke-ne-ha-ha will play the lion if he can not act the part
of the fox. The Shawnees and their allies have force enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to drive all the whites from the banks of the Ohio. They
will try to do it and I think they will succeed.”</p>

<p>“I say, Girty,” said Kendrick, suddenly, “why do you give
the girl to the Indians? Why not keep her for yourself?
She is young and pretty; a prize for any man.”</p>

<p>“I have thought of that,” replied the other; “perhaps the
knowledge that his daughter was mine would give more pain
to Treveling than anything else.”</p>

<p>“I should think it likely.”</p>

<p>“I will think about the matter; but now let us to Chillicothe
as fast as our legs will carry us. Soon we will return with
brand and steel. Dying men and blazing roof-trees shall
mark our path.”</p>

<p>Then the two plunged into the thicket, and soon their forms
were lost in the mazes of the wood.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the little glade was deserted by all living
things, and then again life stood within the forest opening.</p>

<p>Forth from the cover of the wood came the strange girl
known as Kanawha Kate. In her hand she carried the long
rifle common to the frontier. In her belt was thrust the keen-edged
scalping-knife of the Indian.</p>

<p>For a moment she paused in the center of the glade and
listened eagerly.</p>

<p>“She is then in the Shawnee village, the prisoner of the
renegade,” she murmured. “She, the promised wife of the
man that I love with all the passion of my nature.” Full of
agony was the tone in which she spoke.</p>

<p>“Why did I permit this terrible love to take possession of
my heart? Why did I not crush it at the moment of its birth?
But my rival is in the power of the Indians. This man, Girty,
may make her his, then she will be removed from my path
forever. Why should I interfere to save her? If Harvey does
not see her again he may forget her, and then I may be able
to win his love. Oh! how full of bliss is even the thought.”</p>

<p>For a moment she stood like one inspired, her eyes flashing
and her lips half-opened. And then a change came over
her face. Her head sunk down listlessly upon her breast.</p>

<p>“Alas! it is but a dream,” she murmured, sorrowfully. “He
will never learn to love me even if she is lost to him. I have
forgotten the stain that clings to me. Forgotten that I am
the daughter of the renegade. One at whom the finger of
scorn is pointed. A wretched creature not fit to associate
with others whose skins are white like mine. I am an outcast,
a child of the forest. What madness then to think that
I can ever win the love of a man like Harvey Winthrop.
No, it is impossible.”</p>

<p>Slowly and mournfully Kate spoke, as the truth forced itself
upon her mind.</p>

<p>“I must to the Shawnee village!” she cried, suddenly.
“The Indians know me as the daughter of the renegade
and will not harm me. On my way through the forest I can
decide on what course to pursue. Whether to leave Virginia
to her fate, to the cruel mercy of having her life spared by
Girty, only to become his wife; or to save her—if it be possible—and
give her to the man who has, unknowingly, won
my heart. Oh! to leave her to Girty is a terrible temptation;
Heaven give me strength to resist it!”</p>

<p>Then through the wood Kate followed on the trail of her
father and Girty.</p>

<p>Cautiously she followed on the trail till it led into the Indian
village by the bank of the Scioto, known as Chillicothe.</p>

<p>In the thicket that fringed the village, Kate halted.</p>

<p>“Now, what course shall I pursue?” she asked, communing
with herself. “Shall I go at once boldly into the village
and say that I have come to seek my father? or shall I remain
here in concealment and watch my opportunity to enter
the village unobserved?”</p>

<p>For a few moments Kate pondered over the difficult question.
She could not decide which of the two courses to
adopt.</p>

<p>Then from a wigwam, in full view of the thicket that concealed
the girl, came Girty and Kendrick.</p>

<p>They bent their steps slowly toward the river.</p>

<p>“I have it!” cried Kale, suddenly; “I will tell my father
that I feared to remain alone in my cabin and brave the dangers
of the Indian attack, and that I wish to remain here until
the war is ended. They will not suspect my purpose.”</p>

<p>And having come to this conclusion, she stepped forward
from the shelter of the thicket.</p>

<p>The two men started with surprise when they beheld the
girl.</p>

<p>“Why, Kate, what brings you here?” asked Kendrick, in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“I am in search of you, father,” she replied.</p>

<p>“What do you want with me?”</p>

<p>“I have thought over your warning regarding the Indian
attack, and have concluded to seek shelter here,” she replied.</p>

<p>“It’s the best thing you kin do,” said Kendrick, approvingly.</p>

<p>Girty’s face wore a strange expression as he looked up at the
girl.</p>

<p>“Is this your daughter?” he said, in an undertone to Kendrick.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the other replied; “don’t you remember her?”</p>

<p>“Her face is familiar to me,” said Girty, with a puzzled
air, “yet I can not remember ever meeting her before.”</p>

<p>“She was with me, hyer in the nation, some five years
ago; of course she’s changed a good deal since that time.”</p>

<p>“That is probably the reason why her face seems strange
and yet familiar to me. But come this way a moment. I
have something to say to you.”</p>

<p>Kendrick followed Girty. A few paces on, out of ear-shot
of the girl, Girty halted.</p>

<p>“Is your daughter to be trusted?” Girty asked.</p>

<p>“Why what do you mean?” said Kendrick, in wonder.</p>

<p>“I mean is she red at heart, like ourselves? Does she hate
the whites?”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon that she doesn’t bear ’em much love. The
settlers have allers looked upon her as they would upon a
spotted snake; a pretty thing, but dangerous, and not to
be trusted, and not to be handled. But why do you ask the
question?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. I want some one to look after this girl.”</p>

<p>“Why not get one of the squaws?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid to trust her with them. Of course I shall
have to go with Ke-ne-ha-ha, on his expedition against the
whites. If any reverse should happen to the Indians, and the
news of it reach the village in my absence, they might take
revenge upon the girl.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s very true.”</p>

<p>“But if I can get your daughter to take charge of her, why
that danger will be avoided.”</p>

<p>“Well, you kin ask the gal. I guess she’ll be willing to do
it,” said Kendrick.</p>

<p>“I’ll pay her well for the service. The presence, too, of
one of her own blood may serve to reconcile the girl to her
fate, or, at any rate, it will serve to rob her captivity of half
its terrors.”</p>

<p>“Better speak to Kate right away.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Then the two returned to the girl.</p>

<p>“Kate, my friend hyer wants you to do a little favor for
him,” said Kendrick.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Kate, and even as she spoke the
thought came into her mind that the favor had something to
do with the captive maid.</p>

<p>“There is a white girl in the village, not exactly a prisoner
to the Indians, fur I intend to marry her, but still she is not
free. I would like to have you take charge of her; do all
you can to make her contented with and accept the fate that
is before her. I will pay you well for the service.”</p>

<p>“What is her name?” and not a muscle of Kate’s face betrayed
that she knew what the name would be even before it
was spoken.</p>

<p>“Virginia Treveling,” replied Girty, after hesitating for a
moment, but then an instant’s reflection convinced him that
it would be folly to attempt to conceal the name of the prisoner.</p>

<p>“Very well, I will do it,” said Kate, quietly.</p>

<p>“I told you I thought she would,” said Kendrick, with an
air of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“She is in yonder wigwam,” and Girty pointed to one that
stood by the bank of the Scioto, a hundred paces or so from
where they were.</p>

<p>“I will take good care of her,” Kate said, and neither of the
two that stood by her side guessed the double meaning conveyed
in her words.</p>

<p>And so Kate was placed to guard the captive Virginia. In
her heart two passions struggled for supremacy. The fate of
her rival was in her hands. Would she save or crush her?</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE GREAT MEDICINE.</span></h2>


<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha gazed at the old Medicine Man in astonishment,
not unmixed with awe.</p>

<p>“Did the great chief hear right? Did my father say that he
could show the Wolf Demon to Ke-ne-ha-ha?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Great Medicine of the Shawnee nation can raise
the dead—can bring the evil spirit—the Wolf Demon—from
the air, the earth, or from the fire where he has his wigwam,”
chanted the old Indian.</p>

<p>For a few moments in silence the Shawnee chief looked up
on the Great Medicine.</p>

<p>“My father speaks straight,” he said, at length, breaking
the silence. “His tongue is not forked. Is the wolf Demon
an Indian devil?”</p>

<p>“No, white.”</p>

<p>“White!” and the chief started.</p>

<p>“Yes, as white as the Ohio waves when the Great Spirit
lashes them with his storm-whip, and they bind white plumes
around their scalp-locks.”</p>

<p>The chief pondered with moody brows. The old Indian
from the covert of his blankets watched him with searching
eyes.</p>

<p>“Then the Great Medicine can show me the Wolf Demon?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Does the chief see that green stick?” and the old Indian
pointed to the fire.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When that stick becomes a flaming brand, then turns to a
blackened coal, the Wolf Demon will be here.”</p>

<p>“In this wigwam?” asked the chief, in wonder.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why not before?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Wolf Demon is far down below the earth. His home
is in the fire that burns in the mouth of the tortoise that
carries the earth on his back. He can not come in an instant.
The Great Medicine knew that Ke-ne-ha-ha would seek his
counsel before the young moon died. He knew that the
chief would wish to see the Wolf Demon, and he summoned
him from the land of shadows long ago. But for that, the
chief would not be able to have his wish gratified to-night.”</p>

<p>“The Wolf Demon will come, then?” and instinctively
Ke-ne-ha-ha’s hand sought the handle of his tomahawk as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“Yes; the chief is wise to prepare, for the Wolf Demon
comes to take his life.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” and Ke-ne ha-ha’s eyes shot lurid fires as he uttered
the simple exclamation.</p>

<p>“Does the chief fear?”</p>

<p>“What! the white devil? ugh! Ke-ne-ha-ha’s heart is like
rock. He does not fear.”</p>

<p>“Then the chief will meet and fight the Wolf Demon?”
asked the Great Medicine.</p>

<p>“Yes, if the Wolf Demon comes, the chief will fight him.
Many great warriors have fallen by the tomahawk of the
Wolf Demon. He is a coward. He does not attack the
Shawnee braves like a warrior and a man. He creeps behind
them in the forest like a cat and strikes them in the back.
He will not dare to meet Ke-ne-ha-ha, face to face.”</p>

<p>“See, the green stick is burning,” and the Medicine Man
looked toward the fire as he spoke. “When it is ashes, the
chief will stand face to face with the Wolf Demon. He will
tremble like a squaw when he sees the white man’s devil.”</p>

<p>“The Great Medicine is wise, but he lies when he says that
Ke-ne-ha-ha will tremble!” cried the Shawnee chief, anger
sparkling in his eyes. “The great fighting-man of the Shawnee
nation never turned his back to mortal foe, either red or
white-skinned warrior. Why should he fear the devil that
hides in the wood, and who, like a coward, strikes his foes in
the back?” And Ke-ne-ha-ha drew himself up proudly, as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“The chief has the heart of a lion; it is a pity that he
should die like the snake,” said the old Indian, slowly.</p>

<p>“When the chief dies it will be upon the war-path!” exclaimed
the Shawnee brave, in defiance; “a hundred scalps
will hang at his belt—his hand will be red with the blood of
his foe. When he enters the happy hunting-grounds, the
chiefs will bow in homage, to him, and say, ‘Here is a great
warrior; welcome.’”</p>

<p>“The chief is wrong,” said the Great Medicine, slowly;
“he will not die on the war-path. The Great Medicine sees
the future. It is clouded to all other eyes but his. His heart
is Shawnee—it is torn with anguish when he reads the future
and sees the desolation and dismay that must come upon the
Shawnee nation. Before his eyes is a sea of blood, not white
blood but red, the blood of the Indian.”</p>

<p>Over the brow of the chief came a gloomy cloud as he listened
to the prophetic words of the old man.</p>

<p>His heart sunk within him as he heard the prophecy of disaster
and death.</p>

<p>“Does the Great Medicine read the future straight?” he
asked, anxiously. “Is not the blood that he sees the blood
of the white settlers by the banks of the Ohio? the blood of
the false-hearted, crooked-tongued chiefs who have stolen the
lands of the red-men and whose mouths are full of lies?”</p>

<p>Sorrowfully the old Indian shook his head.</p>

<p>“The blood is the life-current of the Shawnees, the Mingoes,
the Wyandots and the Hurons. The heart of the Great
Medicine is sad, but he must speak the truth.”</p>

<p>“Then the expedition of the Shawnee chief against the
whites on the Ohio will be defeated?” asked Ke-ne-ha-ha, with
a frown upon his face.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“The chief will go if he had ten thousand lives to lose and
knew that by the act he would sacrifice them all,” said the
Shawnee, proudly, and with an air of dogged defiance.</p>

<p>“The chief has but one life to lose, and he will lose it in
the Shawnee village by the banks of the Scioto,” said the
Great Medicine.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha started as the words fell upon his ears, and a
look of anger swept over his face.</p>

<p>“Will the chief die by the hand of a spy—a snake who
will creep into the Shawnee village to strike him in the
back?”</p>

<p>“No, Ke-ne-ha-ha will be killed in a fair and open fight,
but he will be killed in the midst of the Shawnees and die in
one of the wigwams of his own people.”</p>

<p>The chief looked puzzled at the strange words of the old Indian.</p>

<p>“Ke-ne-ha-ha does not understand; will my father speak
straighter?”</p>

<p>“The chief does not fear then to learn the future?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Shawnee warrior, proudly.</p>

<p>“Not even when he is to hear of the manner of his death?”</p>

<p>“A warrior must die some time. Ke-ne-ha-ha is ready
when the Great Spirit calls him.”</p>

<p>“Good; the Great Medicine will speak then. He must
speak words that cause him tears of blood, for they tell of the
death of the Shawnee chieftain.”</p>

<p>“Ke-ne-ha-ha’s ears are open—he listens.”</p>

<p>“Before the moon dies, a terrible figure will be in the Shawnee
village. All fly from its path—the birds of the night, and
the insects of the earth—for it is not of human mold. The
moonbeams shining in fear will show the figure of a huge gray
wolf. The wolf walks on its hind legs like a man. It has
the face of a human, and it is striped with war-paint, black
and white. In its paw it carries a tomahawk—the edge is
crusted with blood that dims the brightness of the steel.
The blood comes from the veins of some of the best warriors of
the Shawnee nation. The Little Crow hunted the brown deer
in the woods of the Scioto. He came not back. His brother
found him in the forest dead—the print of a tomahawk in his
skull and a Red Arrow graven on his breast. Watega is another
great brave of the Shawnee nation. Not two sleeps
ago he went with the white red-men—the renegades—on a
scout. He has not come back to his wigwam, though the
others have returned. His squaw sits in his lodge and wonders
where he is. He will never come back. In a little glade
on the other side of the Ohio is his body—a tomahawk cut
in the skull, and on his breast the totem of the Red Arrow.”</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha started. The death of Watega, who was one
of his favorite warriors, startled him.</p>

<p>“Watega dead!” he cried, hardly willing to believe the
news.</p>

<p>“The Great Medicine has said that he sleeps the long sleep
that knows no waking,” chanted the old Indian, his voice
coming from beneath the blankets wrapped around his head
like a voice from the tomb.</p>

<p>“How can my father know that Watega is dead?” demanded
the chief, obstinately refusing to believe.</p>

<p>“Does the Shawnee chief question the power of the Great
Medicine, and yet come to him for advice?” said the old Indian,
with an accent of scorn in his voice.</p>

<p>“My father is sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Watega was a great warrior; peace be with him,” said
the chief, solemnly.</p>

<p>“Little Crow and Watega fell by the tomahawk of the
Wolf Demon in the forest, and not an hour ago the Red Leaf
met his death by the Scioto, and the Wolf Demon dealt the
blow.”</p>

<p>“Ke-ne-ha-ha saw the slain brave, the last victim of the
white devil,” the chief said, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“No, the chief is wrong; not the last victim, for another
Shawnee has felt the keen edge of the tomahawk of the Wolf
Demon, since the Red Leaf died by his hand.”</p>

<p>“Another of my braves killed!” cried Ke-ne-ha-ha, in wonder
and in anger.</p>

<p>“Yes, two have had the totem of the Red Arrow graven on
their breasts since the moon rose.”</p>

<p>“And who was the other?”</p>

<p>“The Great Medicine can not tell the chief now, but the
chief will know when the stick burns to ashes and the Wolf
Demon comes.”</p>

<p>“But the fate of Ke-ne-ha-ha?”</p>

<p>“The red chief will fall by the tomahawk of the Wolf Demon.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments in the wigwam.</p>

<p>Over the face of the Shawnee chief came a look of stern
resolution. There was no trace of fear in the bearing of the
Shawnee.</p>

<p>“Let my father keep his word and bring the white devil,”
Ke-ne-ha-ha said, breaking the silence. “If the Great Spirit
wills that the chief of the Shawnee nation is to die by the
hand of the scourge of his race, Ke-ne-ha-ha is content. But
he will fight the Wolf Demon before he dies.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE STORY OF THE WOLF DEMON.</span></h2>


<p>The little fire sputtered as the flame eat into the heart of
the green stick.</p>

<p>The light chased and toyed with the dark shadows that
lurked, assassin-like, in the corners of the Indian lodge.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha, with a resolute but gloomy brow, looked upon
the old Indian, who sat like a vampire by the embers.</p>

<p>“My father will keep his word?” the chief said, after a silence
of long duration.</p>

<p>“Watch the green stick—when it is ashes the Wolf Demon
will stand before the chief.”</p>

<p>The Shawnee brave gazed upon the Great Medicine in wonder.</p>

<p>“My father is a Great Medicine, to be able to call the white
man’s devil.”</p>

<p>“The Great Spirit wills that the Wolf Demon should come;
the Medicine Man does not bring him. He only knows that
he is coming.”</p>

<p>“Can my father tell me one thing more?” asked the chief,
after thinking for a moment.</p>

<p>“Let the Shawnee brave speak; then the Great Medicine
can answer,” returned the old Indian, ambiguously.</p>

<p>“The chief will speak,” said Ke-ne-ha-ha, decidedly. “The
Wolf Demon has slain many a great brave of the Shawnee nation.
He is only seen by the banks of the Scioto. He strikes
only at the Shawnees. Why does not the white man’s devil
kill also the Wyandot and Mingo warriors? Why does Shawnee
blood alone stain the edge of his tomahawk?”</p>

<p>“The chief is anxious to know why?”</p>

<p>“Yes; can my father tell?”</p>

<p>“The Great Medicine of the Shawnees can tell all things,
either in life or death. Let the chief open his ears, and he
shall hear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ke-ne-ha-ha listens,” said the chief, curtly.</p>

<p>“The Wolf Demon is a white devil, and he hates the Shawnees.
He does not hate the Mingo warrior or the Wyandot
brave, only the Shawnee.”</p>

<p>“But why should he hate the warriors of Ke-ne-ha-ha?”</p>

<p>“Because when the Wolf Demon was on earth they did
him wrong.”</p>

<p>The chief started.</p>

<p>“The Wolf Demon has lived, then, a human?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Will my father tell how that can be?”</p>

<p>“Yes; listen.” The Great Medicine paused for a moment,
as if to collect his thoughts, then again he spoke:</p>

<p>“Twelve moons ago a song-bird dwelt in the wigwams of
the Shawnees, in the village of Chillicothe, by the side of the
Scioto. She was as fair as the rosy morn, as gentle as the
summer wind, as lithe and graceful as the brown deer. She
was called the Red Arrow.”</p>

<p>“The Great Medicine speaks with a straight tongue—the
Red Arrow was the daughter of the great fighting-man of the
Shawnee nation. The chief now mourns for the loss of his
flower.” Ke-ne-ha-ha spoke sadly, and a gloomy cloud was
on his brow as the words came from his lips.</p>

<p>“The Singing Bird was called the Red Arrow—a name fit
more for a chief and a warrior than a bounding fawn—because
when she was born the Great Spirit marked a red arrow—His
totem—on her breast. Over her heart blazoned the
mystic sign, yet her nature was as gentle as the pigeon’s,
though she bore the totem of slaughter.”</p>

<p>“What my father says is true,” said the chief. “All the
Shawnee tribe know of the daughter of Ke-ne-ha-ha and of
the mystic totem that she bore on her breast.”</p>

<p>“But do all the Shawnee chiefs know of the manner of her
death?”</p>

<p>The great chief started at the question and cast a searching
glance into the face of the Great Medicine; that is, he would
have looked into the face of the old Indian had not the blankets,
wrapped around his head, hid it from the gaze of the
chief.</p>

<p>“Does not my father know how the daughter of Ke-ne-ha-ha
died?” asked the chief, slowly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the Great Medicine has heard, but his memory is
bad—he is an old man. Will the great chief tell him?”</p>

<p>“The Red Arrow left the wigwams of her people to wander
in the forest. There she was eaten up by a bear. Ke-ne-ha-ha
and a few of his chosen warriors searched for her and discovered
her fate.”</p>

<p>“The great chief lies to the Medicine Man,” said the old
Indian, calmly.</p>

<p>Fire flashed from the eyes of the chief, and he advanced a
step with a threatening gesture toward the old Indian.</p>

<p>“Does the chief come with lies in his mouth into the sacred
wigwam and then dare to raise his hand in violence to the
Great Medicine Man because the Great Spirit bids his oracle
speak the truth?” said the old Indian, sternly.</p>

<p>With an exclamation of anger, Ke-ne-ha-ha stepped back
to his former position.</p>

<p>“The chief forgot himself—he did not mean to offer harm
to the Great Medicine Man.”</p>

<p>“It is well. Mortal man cannot harm the tongue of the
Great Spirit. The Spirit-fires that flash from the storm-cloud
would strike unto death the warrior that dares to lift his hand
in menace to the Great Medicine of the Shawnee tribe,” said
the aged oracle, impressively.</p>

<p>With an expression of awe upon his features, the chief listened
to the words of the old Indian.</p>

<p>“Let my father forgive and forget,” Ke-ne-ha-ha said,
slowly.</p>

<p>“The Great Medicine will tell the Shawnee chief the fate
of the Red Arrow. She wandered from the wigwams of her
people because she had fallen in love with a pale-face—a
hunter, whose cabin was by the Ohio and Muskingum. She
left home, kindred, all, for the sake of the long-rifle. She became
his squaw. Does the Great Medicine speak truth?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Ke-ne-ha-ha answered, slowly and reluctantly.</p>

<p>“It is good. Does the chief see that it is useless to deceive
the Great Medicine, who can look into men’s hearts and read
what is written there?”</p>

<p>“My father is wise.”</p>

<p>“The Great Spirit has made him so,” answered the old Indian,
solemnly.</p>

<p>“The Great Medicine knows the fate of the Red Arrow?”
Ke-ne-ha-ha asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; the Shawnees found her in the lodge of the pale-face.
They asked her to return to her people. She refused,
for she loved the white hunter. Then the red chiefs went
away, but when the sky grew dark, covered by Manitou’s
mantle, again the Shawnee warriors stood by the lodge of the
pale-face who had stolen from her home the singing-bird of
the Shawnees. The brands were in their hands, the keen-edged
scalping-knives in their belts. They gave to the fire
the lodge of the pale face, and while the flames roared and
crackled, they shot the Red Arrow dead in their midst.”</p>

<p>“The Shawnee woman who forsakes her tribe for a pale-face
stranger deserves to die,” said the chief, sternly.</p>

<p>“The chief speaks straight, for with his own hand he killed
his daughter, the Red Arrow.”</p>

<p>“And would also kill Le-a-pah, his other singing-bird, if
she left the village of her fathers to sing in the wigwam of a
white-skin,” exclaimed Ke-ne-ha-ha, with stern accents.</p>

<p>“It is good.”</p>

<p>“Why has my father told of the death of the bird who flew
from her nest to dwell with the stranger?”</p>

<p>“Does not the chief wish to know why the Wolf Demon
kills only the Shawnee warriors?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but what has that to do with the dead singing-bird?”
Ke-ne-ha-ha said, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Does not the Wolf Demon leave as his totem on the
breast of his victims a Red Arrow?”</p>

<p>The chief started. For the first time the thought that the
mark of the Wolf Demon and the name of his murdered
daughter were alike, flashed across his mind.</p>

<p>“Why does the Wolf Demon take for his totem a Red Arrow?”
demanded the chief.</p>

<p>“Let the chief open his ears and he shall hear,” said the old
Indian, gravely. “When the lodge of the white hunter was
burnt to the ground, and the body of the singing-bird lay before
the warriors disfigured by the flames, they looked for the
white hunter, but could not find him.”</p>

<p>“He was not in the lodge when my braves attacked it,” interrupted
the chief.</p>

<p>“Ke-ne-ha-ha is wrong. The white hunter was in the
lodge. He saw the singing-bird fly from life to death, and
was wounded by the bullets of the Shawnee warriors; then,
when the lodge fell, he was buried beneath the ruins. The
eyes of the red braves were sharp, but they did not discover
the wounded and helpless white-skin under the blackened
logs. The red chiefs went away, satisfied with their vengeance.
The white brave lay between life and death. A huge
gray wolf came from the forest. He found the senseless man
under the logs. The forest beast was hungry; he thirsted for
human blood. The great gray wolf eat up the wounded white-skin.
The body of the white went into the stomach of the
wolf; it died, but the soul of the white hunter lived. It did
not fly from the body but went with it. The soul of the wolf
was small, the soul of the white hunter large, and the large
soul eat up the little one. The wolf became a wolf with a
human soul. The soul remembered the wrong that the
Shawnee warriors had done its body; it burned for revenge.
It made the wolf walk erect like a human; it taught him to
carry in his paw the tomahawk of the red-man—to steal upon
the Shawnee chiefs in the forest—to give their souls to the
dark spirit and to graven on their breasts the totem of the
Red Arrow. Thus the soul keeps alive the memory of the
squaw that the Shawnee warriors killed.”</p>

<p>The chief listened with amazement.</p>

<p>“How long will the wolf, who has a human soul, be an
avenging angel to give to the death the warriors of my tribe?”
the chief asked.</p>

<p>“How many warriors were with Ke-ne-ha-ha when he killed
the Red Arrow?”</p>

<p>“Ten.”</p>

<p>“Where are they now?”</p>

<p>The chief started. Of the ten warriors not one was living.
All were dead, killed by the Wolf Demon. Each one bore
the mark of the Red Arrow.</p>

<p>“Only one remains, Ke-ne-ha-ha, the great chief of the
Shawnee nation. He will die by the tomahawk of the human
wolf, and then the Demon will go to the land of shadows.”</p>

<p>With a sharp crack, the green stick snapped in twain. The
fire had eaten to the core. The Medicine Man arose.</p>

<p>“Let the chief prepare. The Wolf Demon is near.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">A TERRIBLE ENCOUNTER.</span></h2>


<p>Quietly the Indian chief drew the keen-edged scalping
knife from his girdle. Every muscle in his massive frame was
nerved for the coming contest.</p>

<p>The little fire, now burnt down to a mass of glowing embers,
but faintly lighted up the gloom of the wigwam.</p>

<p>The Medicine Man turned his back to the chief, slowly disengaged
himself from the huge blanket wrapped around him,
and then held it up in the air.</p>

<p>The blanket concealed the form of the Medicine Man from
the eyes of Ke-ne-ha-ha.</p>

<p>Darker and darker grew the gloom.</p>

<p>“Is the chief ready to see the Wolf Demon?” asked the
Medicine Man, his voice vibrating with a strange accent.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the Shawnee warrior, slowly and undauntedly.</p>

<p>“Ere the heart of the warrior can beat ten, the Wolf Demon
will stand before him,” chanted the solemn voice of the
old Indian.</p>

<p>Then all was silent.</p>

<p>In the stillness, the throbbings of the Indian’s heart seemed
to his excited fancy to make as big a noise as the foot-fall
of the brown deer falling upon the forest-glade.</p>

<p>More and more dense grew the gloom.</p>

<p>The blanket that had concealed the figure of the Medicine
Man from the chief dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>The old Indian had disappeared.</p>

<p>In his place stood the terrible form that all living things
shrunk from.</p>

<p>Face to face with the chief of the Shawnee nation stood
the Wolf Demon!</p>

<p>In his paw he held the death-dealing tomahawk, whose
edge, even now, was crusted red with Shawnee blood.</p>

<p>The eyeballs of the chief were distended with horror as he
looked upon the awful form. But no thought of fear was in
the mind of the Shawnee warrior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment the foemen glared upon each other.</p>

<p>Then, swift as the flash of the lightning, the Wolf Demon
leaped upon his destined prey.</p>

<p>The wild war-note of the Shawnee nation burst from the
lips of Ke-ne-ha-ha, as he struck desperately at the huge form
that sprung so fiercely upon him.</p>

<p>The keen scalping-knife cut deep into the side of the Wolf
Demon, but met no flesh in its passage, only hide and
hair.</p>

<p>The tomahawk of the unknown being came down upon the
head of the chief, but glancing in its course, inflicted only a
slight flesh wound.</p>

<p>The two closed together in mortal conflict.</p>

<p>Alarmed by the war-cry of the chief, the Shawnee warriors
came pouring into the wigwam.</p>

<p>In the gloom they could only discover that two dark figures
were grappling with each other upon the ground that formed
the floor of the lodge, in a furious struggle.</p>

<p>Amazed, the warriors paused. In the darkness they could
not tell which of the two dark forms—interlaced so snake-like
together—was friend or foe.</p>

<p>The combatants paid no heed to the entrance of the warriors,
so engrossed were they in their terrible struggle.</p>

<p>For a moment the Indians stood like statues, gazing in bewilderment
upon the strange scene before them.</p>

<p>Then, actuated by a sudden thought, one of the Shawnees—wiser
than his fellows—dashed from the wigwam to the fire
that burned near to the lodge of the Medicine Man.</p>

<p>The chief snatched a flaming brand from the fire, and then
re-entered the wigwam.</p>

<p>The struggle between the two upon the ground had ceased.
One had conquered the other.</p>

<p>By the light of the burning fagot the amazed Indians looked
upon a fearful scene.</p>

<p>In the center of the wigwam, flat upon his back, and with
the blood streaming freely from a wound in his temple, lay
Ke-ne-ha-ha, the great chief of the Shawnee nation.</p>

<p>Over him, with his foot planted upon his breast, and the
blood-stained tomahawk upraised in menace in his hand, was
the terrible being that wore the shape of a wolf and the face
of a man.</p>

<p>The blood of the warriors congealed within their veins as
they looked upon the awful picture.</p>

<p>For a moment the Wolf Demon held his position, with his
foot placed in triumph upon the body of the prostrate chief.
Then, with a hoarse yell of defiance, he sprung forward upon
the warriors gathered in the doorway of the lodge.</p>

<p>With a howl of terror, the Shawnees scattered in fear, tumbling
over each other in their fright.</p>

<p>Two quick and powerful strokes of the keen-edged tomahawk,
and two more Shawnees were sent to the happy hunting-grounds.</p>

<p>Swift as the hunted deer ran the Wolf Demon through the
Indian village.</p>

<p>The warriors, recovering a little from their fright, and with
the boldness that the sense of overpowering numbers gives,
followed in pursuit.</p>

<p>The yells of the Indians rung out shrill on the still night-air.</p>

<p>Increasing in speed at every stride, the Wolf Demon headed
for the thicket.</p>

<p>Far in the rear followed the warriors.</p>

<p>With a hoarse yell of defiance, the terrible figure gained
the shelter of the wood, and disappeared within its shadows.</p>

<p>On the borders of the wood the Indians halted. All the village
had been aroused by the terrible outcry, and great was
the wonder and alarm of the Shawnees when they learned
that the terrible Wolf Demon had been in their midst.</p>

<p>After a short consultation, the warriors entered the thicket.
But ten paces within the wood all traces of the passage of the
Wolf Demon vanished. He had disappeared as utterly as if
the earth had opened and swallowed him.</p>

<p>Keen-witted as the Shawnee chiefs were, they never dreamed
of examining the oak branches that waved over their heads.
They little thought that, even as they paused within the wood,
in wonderment and dismay, from his leafy covert in the
branches above their heads, the terrible Wolf Demon glared
down upon them, and laughed, with fierce joy, when, puzzled
and beaten, they took their way in sullen anger back to
the Indian village.</p>

<p>The Indians gone, the strange form descended from his
perch in the branches of the oak, and, with a rapid but silent
tread, stole through the mazes of the forest.</p>

<p>While some of the Indians had been pursuing the phantom
form, others had given their attention to the wounded chief.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha had suffered but little. Two slight cuts on the
head, inflicted by the tomahawk of the Wolf Demon—mere
flesh wounds—were all the damage he had received.</p>

<p>To his wondering warriors the chief told the story of the
interview with the Great Medicine Man, and the sudden appearance
of the terrible scourge of the Shawnee nation, the
Wolf Demon.</p>

<p>Then, to the horror of the savages, on examining the wigwam,
in one corner, covered by a blanket, they found the
Great Medicine Man, <em>dead</em>!</p>

<p>The terrible tomahawk-cut on his head, and the totem of
the Red Arrow carved upon his breast, told of the manner of
his death and the doer of the deed.</p>

<p>The Great Medicine Man of the Shawnees had indeed been
slain by the Wolf Demon.</p>

<p>By a miracle Ke-ne-ha-ha had escaped. It was evidently
not fated that he was to die so soon.</p>

<p>Carefully they wiped the blood from the face and garments
of the chief and bound up his wounds.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha at once called a council of his principal warriors.</p>

<p>By the time the council had assembled, the party that had
pursued the Wolf Demon returned and told of their failure
to trace the terrible being through the forest.</p>

<p>Calmly the chief addressed the council.</p>

<p>He told of the dreadful hand-to-hand encounter that he had
had with the white man’s devil. Declared that the charm
was broken, and that the Wolf Demon no longer was to be
feared.</p>

<p>The warriors took heart at the bold address of the great
chief.</p>

<p>Then Ke-ne-ha-ha urged the necessity of making an immediate
attack upon the white settlements along the Ohio.</p>

<p>In this the chief was supported by every warrior within
the council. All were eager for the attack. All thirsted for
the blood of the white-skins.</p>

<p>The council broke up, and earnestly the warriors donned
their war-paint in readiness for the coming fight.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the expedition was to start on the
morrow, and that Point Pleasant should be the first station
attacked.</p>

<p>Girty and Kendrick had been in the council, and on its
breaking up, walked slowly along together.</p>

<p>“The chief is terribly in earnest,” said Kendrick, as they
proceeded onward.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’ll be a leaden hail rattling around Point Pleasant
soon,” responded Girty.</p>

<p>“What do you think of this Wolf Demon?” asked Kendrick,
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t exactly know what to think,” said Girty,
with a puzzled air.</p>

<p>“The chief had a tussle with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the warriors saw him when he fled through the
village. A huge gray wolf walking erect on its hind legs
like a man and with a human face.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t a spook, ’cos the Indians wouldn’t have been able
to have seen it.”</p>

<p>“No, but what is it?” asked Girty.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve got me,” said Kendrick, with a dubious shake
of the head.</p>

<p>“Man or devil, if he ever comes within range of my rifle
I’ll wager that I’ll drill a hole through him,” said Girty, decidedly.</p>

<p>“Well, the chief failed,” observed Kendrick. “He said that
he struck his knife clean through his side, and yet not a drop
of blood was on the blade.”</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful, to say the least,” said Girty.</p>

<p>And then the two entered their wigwam.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">A FRIEND IN NEED.</span></h2>


<p>Virginia, in the solitude of the wigwam, full of bitter
thoughts, and mourning, silently, over the hard fortune that
had befallen her, was surprised by the entrance of a female
form.</p>

<p>Looking up in astonishment, she beheld Kate.</p>

<p>A cry of joy came from the lips of the hopeless girl. In
Kate she beheld a friend!</p>

<p>A warning gesture from the Kanawha Queen checked Virginia’s
utterance, and the words of welcome died away upon
her lips.</p>

<p>“Be careful, lady,” said Kate, warningly; “a loud word to
betray to other ears that we know each other, and both of us
are lost.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is so hard to keep back the joy that struggles to
my lips,” murmured Virginia; “your presence here seems
like a ray of sunlight beaming full upon the dark pathway
through which runs the current of my life. Your face gives
me life and hope.”</p>

<p>Kate gazed into the upturned face of the fair girl with a
mournful smile.</p>

<p>“You are in great danger, lady,” she said, slowly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know that!” cried Virginia, quickly. “I am a
prisoner in the hands of the merciless red-men.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a prisoner in the hands of one who is more merciless
than any painted savage that roams the valley of the Ohio.
A man whose skin is white but whose heart is red,” said Kate,
mournfully.</p>

<p>Virginia gazed at Kate in wonder.</p>

<p>“In Heaven’s name, of whom do you speak?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Of one to whom the hungry wolf is a lamb; of one who
knows neither fear nor pity. A white Indian; an outcast
from his country and his race.”</p>

<p>Virginia shuddered at the terrible words.</p>

<p>“A renegade?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you are a prisoner in his hands, not the captive of
the Shawnees. Far better were it for you if the red Indians
held your fate in their hands,” Kate said, impressively.</p>

<p>“And the name of this man?”</p>

<p>“Simon Girty.”</p>

<p>Virginia’s heart sunk within her as the name of the dreaded
renegade fell upon her ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven help me, then!” she murmured, “for I am in
terrible peril.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right,” said Kate, quickly; “you are in peril.
A miracle alone can save you.”</p>

<p>“Where am I?” Virginia asked.</p>

<p>“In the village of Chillicothe.”</p>

<p>“Among the Shawnees!”</p>

<p>“Yes; this is the village of their great chief, Ke-ne-ha-ha.”</p>

<p>“I have heard my father speak of him,” Virginia said,
thoughtfully. “He bears a deadly hatred to the whites.”</p>

<p>“Yes; he has sworn to drive the pale-faces back from the
Ohio. Even now the savages are arming and preparing for
the fight.”</p>

<p>“Then my father and friends will be in danger!” cried Virginia.</p>

<p>“What is their danger compared to yours?” asked Kate.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true,” said Virginia, mournfully, “but, for
the moment, the thought of their peril made me forget my
own helpless situation.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen this man—Girty?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You do not know, then, why he has selected you for his
victim?”</p>

<p>“No,” again Virginia replied.</p>

<p>“Strange,” said Kate, thoughtfully. “I cannot understand
it. He must have some motive in entrapping you from your
home and friends and bringing you here.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you all the particulars.”</p>

<p>Then Virginia told the story of her abduction.</p>

<p>Kate listened attentively.</p>

<p>The story puzzled her. She could not understand the
double abduction.</p>

<p>“Have you no suspicion as to who this man is that pretended
to rescue you from your first captors, but in reality led you
into the hands of the second party?”</p>

<p>“No,” Virginia said.</p>

<p>“The false guide was Simon Girty.”</p>

<p>Virginia uttered a sharp cry as though she had received a
terrible wound.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake be silent or it will cost us both our
lives!” cried Kate, quickly and with great caution.</p>

<p>“I will not offend again,” murmured Virginia, the big tears
beginning to well slowly from her lustrous brown eyes. “But
I have such a terrible weight pressing upon my heart. I feel
that I am utterly lost.”</p>

<p>“No, do not despair; there may still be a chance to escape
from the toils that surround you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! show me some way to escape and I will go down on
my knees and thank you!” cried Virginia Treveling, earnestly.</p>

<p>“I do not ask that,” said Kate, with a mournful expression
in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>“But how is it that you are here in the Indian village?
Are you a prisoner, too?” asked Virginia, suddenly.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Kate, her eyes seeking the ground.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand,” said Virginia, in wonder.</p>

<p>“Do you not remember who and what I am?” asked Kate,
a tinge of bitterness perceptible in her tones. “Am I not
Kate, the Queen of the Kanawha, the daughter of the pale-faced
Indian, David Kendrick, the renegade?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I remember now,” said Virginia: “I ask your
pardon if my question has given you pain. I did not intend
or think to wound you.”</p>

<p>“Do not fear. I have heard too many bitter speeches in
my short life to be galled now by a chance word. I cannot
be wounded by a random shot. I am the daughter of a renegade;
all the world knows it. It would be useless to deny
the truth. I must bear patiently the stain that my birth and
my father’s deeds have fixed upon me. I cannot cast aside
the shame that clings to me and through no act of mine. All
the world despises me. Is it not enough to make me hate all
the world?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Virginia, softly, “you are not to blame for the
deeds of others. Live so that your life shall be a telling reproof
to those who would blame you for the acts of your father.
I do not think any the worse of you because you are
the daughter of David Kendrick, the renegade. No, I rather
pity you. I told you so when first we met in the ravine near
Point Pleasant, and I repeat the words, now that I am here a
captive in the hands of my enemies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, lady, you have the heart of an angel!” cried Kate
earnestly.</p>

<p>“No, I am only a poor weak girl in deadly peril,” said
Virginia, simply.</p>

<p>“Lady, I will try and save you from the danger that surrounds
you!” cried Kate, impulsively.</p>

<p>“You will?” murmured Virginia, her face lighting up with
joy.</p>

<p>“Yes; can you guess why I am here?”</p>

<p>“No,” Virginia replied, in wonder.</p>

<p>“I am placed here by Girty to watch you.”</p>

<p>“To watch me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, so that you can not escape from the toils that his
cunning has drawn around you.”</p>

<p>“And you will break faith with him and save me?” asked
Virginia, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Heaven will surely bless you for the act!” cried Virginia,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may need that blessing,” said Kate, earnestly.</p>

<p>“I am sure that you do not!” exclaimed Virginia, impulsively.
“I read in your face that your heart is good and
noble, and I am sure that your face does not deceive me.”</p>

<p>“I will try and keep faith with you. I have promised one
who loves you dearly, that, if you were within a hundred
miles of the Ohio, neither swamp nor wood, house nor wigwam
should hide you from me. I have kept that promise and
have found you. But one more task remains for me to do
and that is, to save you from the perils that now surround
you, and give you safe and unharmed into his arms.”</p>

<p>Virginia listened with wonder to this strange speech.</p>

<p>“One who loves me dearly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, better far, I think, than he does his own life.”</p>

<p>“I can not understand,” said Virginia, bewildered.</p>

<p>“Is there not some one whom you love? One who holds
your plighted faith?” asked Kate.</p>

<p>“There <em>was</em> one,” and as Virginia spoke, the tears came
slowly into her eyes. Back to her memory came the scene
in the ravine. In imagination she felt again the warm, passionate
kiss of the man she loved so well; then, an instant
after, saw him stretched bleeding and senseless upon the earth
at her feet.</p>

<p>“There <em>is</em> one now. You speak of Harvey Winthrop?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” cried Virginia, almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>“He is living.”</p>

<p>“<em>Living?</em>”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Virginia sprung to her feet, her face flushed with joy.</p>

<p>“Oh! and I have mourned him as one lost to me forever.”</p>

<p>“By a happy chance I discovered him in the ravine, helpless.
Then I carried him to my cabin and he is there now.”</p>

<p>“Is he wounded dangerously?” Virginia asked, the color
forsaking her cheeks as she thought of the illness of her lover.</p>

<p>“No, only a flesh wound,” Kate answered. “In a few
days he will be well again. He told me that you were his
plighted wife, and I promised him that I would find you if
you were living and upon the earth. But I little expected,
though, to find you a captive in the Shawnee village.”</p>

<p>“Can you save me from the terrible danger that surrounds
me?” Virginia asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>“At least I can try. Heaven alone knows whether the attempt
will be successful or not,” replied Kate, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Oh, my heart sinks within me when I think of the many
miles that intervene between me and my kindred. I fear I
shall never see Point Pleasant again. How can we make our
way through the trackless wilderness, the home of the wild
beast and the red savage?” Virginia asked, in sorrow.</p>

<p>“Do not fear; to me the wilderness is like an open book.
Not a path between here and the Ohio that I do not know as
well in the darkness as in the light. Trust to me, and if human
aid is of avail you shall be saved.”</p>

<p>Then, with a gesture of caution, Kate left the lodge.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">FATHER AND DAUGHTER.</span></h2>


<p>As Kate left the lodge and turned to the right toward the
river, she found herself suddenly confronted by her father,
David Kendrick.</p>

<p>There was a peculiar grin upon the face of the renegade as
he looked upon his daughter.</p>

<p>“Been in to see the little gal, hey?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Kate replied.</p>

<p>“Been making a neighborly call, hey? Does the critter
know you?”</p>

<p>Kate felt that deception would be useless, so she answered
truthfully.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where did you ever meet her?”</p>

<p>“At Point Pleasant.”</p>

<p>“How does she feel?”</p>

<p>“Badly, of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s nat’ral,” said the renegade, with another grin.</p>

<p>“I should think so.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose you told her that it would be all right—that the
chances were that she would be taken back to the station
’fore long, hey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did tell her so,” Kate said, puzzled at the odd manner
of her father.</p>

<p>“Now, see how good I am at guessing. I ought to set up
to onc’t for a Great Medicine Man,” and the renegade laughed,
discordantly.</p>

<p>Kate cast a searching glance into her father’s face, but she
found nothing there to aid her in guessing the meaning of his
strange conduct.</p>

<p>“Have you any thing else to say to me?” and Kate made
a movement as if to pass the renegade and proceed on her
course.</p>

<p>“Hold on, gal!” cried Kendrick, hastily. “I’ve got a heap
to say to you. Jist foller me off a piece, whar we’ll be out of
ear-shot of any skulker, and then I’ll talk to you like a Dutch
uncle,” and again the renegade laughed discordantly.</p>

<p>With a mind ill at ease Kate followed her father. His
manner boded danger. Yet she could not imagine in what
shape that danger would come.</p>

<p>The renegade led the way toward the wood.</p>

<p>On the border of the thicket he paused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Close to where he stood was a fallen tree—a huge sycamore.</p>

<p>“Sit down, gal!” and he indicated with his hand the tree-trunk,
as he spoke.</p>

<p>Kate obeyed the command.</p>

<p>“Now, jist wait quiet a moment, till I scout round and see
if thar is anybody in the timber nigh us.”</p>

<p>Then into the thicket he went.</p>

<p>Five minutes’ search convinced the renegade that there
was no one near. Then he returned to the spot where he had
left Kate and took a seat on the tree-trunk by her side.</p>

<p>“Thar, gal, we kin talk here without any danger of any
pryin’ sucker a-hearin’ our talk.”</p>

<p>“Have you any thing particular to say that you are so
afraid of being overheard?” asked Kate.</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” replied Kendrick, after a pause. “I would
rather a heap sight that only two pair of ears should hear
what we’re going to say.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>Kate spoke calmly, yet she had a presentiment that a storm
was about to burst over her head.</p>

<p>“Gal, you don’t play keerds of course, but I guess you understand
what I mean when I tell you to play with your
keerds on the table and not under it,” said the renegade, significantly.</p>

<p>“No,” said Kate, calmly, “I do not understand what you
mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t,” and the tone of the renegade was clearly
one of unbelief. “Shall I speak plainer then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you wish me to understand,” Kate said, quietly.</p>

<p>Kendrick looked at his daughter in wonder. Her calmness
staggered him.</p>

<p>“Well, you are a cool hand. If I wasn’t certain of my
game now, I should think that, like a green dog, I was barking
up the wrong tree. But the trail is too clear for me to be
throw’d off.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Neither Kate’s voice or face showed
the least sign of alarm or excitement.</p>

<p>“I must spit it right out, hey?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If so be, so good. Well, gal, I’ve got a powerful long
pair of ears. I were a-passing back of the wigwam where the
little gal is, a few minutes ago, and I heerd something that
made me want to hear more.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” Kate’s face was as impassible as the face of a
statue, and her voice as cold as ice.</p>

<p>“So I listened and heerd a good deal.”</p>

<p>“What did you hear?”</p>

<p>“’Bout all you said to the little gal,” replied Kendrick, with
a grin. “I heerd you tell her ’bout the young feller that you
saved in the ravine. I s’pose he’s the one I saw in your cabin
t’other day, hey?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Kate replied.</p>

<p>“Well, I thought so when you spoke of him. And then it
struck me what a funny idea it was for you to be ’tending and
fussing over another gal’s feller.”</p>

<p>“It is strange, isn’t it?” said Kate, with a peculiar look. Her
father did not notice the odd look.</p>

<p>“Well, I thought it was; but then, you were always a
cranky piece, full of odd notions.”</p>

<p>“Then you know that I have promised to rescue the girl
from her present dangerous situation?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I do,” replied Kendrick; “don’t I tell you
that I heard the whole thing as you talked it over?”</p>

<p>“Do you know why I wish to save the girl from Girty?”</p>

<p>“No, unless you’ve got the milk of human kindness so
strong in your breast that it urges you to save the gal, ’cos
she’s in a tight place,” said the renegade, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“No, it is not that.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“I love the same man that she does.”</p>

<p>“Jerusalem!” cried Kendrick, in wonder.</p>

<p>“It is the truth.”</p>

<p>“You mean this young feller, Harvey Winthrop?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Does he care any thing about you?”</p>

<p>“How can he when he is in love with this girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true.”</p>

<p>“That is the reason that I wish to take her from here.”</p>

<p>The renegade looked at Kate in wonder.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” he said, in utter amazement. “You
say that you love the feller, and yet you are going to give
your rival to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how dull you are!” cried Kate, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well I may be,” said Kendrick, doggedly. “Anyway, I
can’t make head nor tail out of your words. If you love the
young feller and want him, I should think that giving him the
girl that he likes better than he does you, was jist the way <em>not</em>
to get him.”</p>

<p>“What will be the fate of the girl if she stays here in the
Indian village?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose Girty will make a sort of left-handed wife
out of her. I believe that’s his idea.”</p>

<p>“But is there not a chance that she may escape or be rescued
by her friends?” demanded Kate.</p>

<p>“Of course there’s the chance. It ain’t likely, but still it
<em>might</em> happen so.”</p>

<p>“And if she should escape I could never hope to win the
love of Harvey Winthrop.”</p>

<p>“Well, I s’pose that’s Gospel truth.”</p>

<p>“You may be sure that it is the truth!” exclaimed Kate,
earnestly. “But if she never returns to the settlement of
course he will never see her again. Then he will forget her.
I have a double claim to his gratitude if not to his love.
Twice have I saved his life.”</p>

<p>“But gratitude ain’t love.”</p>

<p>“No, father; but the space that separates the two sentiments
is but a slight one. Once this girl is out of the way he
will learn to love me; I am sure of it.”</p>

<p>“But you say you are going to give the girl back to him?”</p>

<p>“When you go upon the war-path do you openly tell the
foe that you are coming and bid him prepare to meet you?”</p>

<p>“Well, no; not generally, gal,” replied the renegade, who
began to have a dim perception of his daughter’s plan.</p>

<p>“Neither do I. Cunning is my weapon. The girl thinks
me her friend. Willingly she will consent to be guided by me.
By stealth we will leave the Indian village. Once within the
fastness of the thicket, what will prevent me from removing
my rival forever from my path?”</p>

<p>Kendrick gazed at his daughter in admiration.</p>

<p>“You’re a cute gal, by hookey; but what will Girty say
when he discovers that the gal is gone?”</p>

<p>“What can he say, or what do I care what he says?” demanded
Kate, spiritedly. “You do not owe Simon Girty
many favors, father.”</p>

<p>“I don’t owe him any,” replied the renegade. “It’s nothing
to me if the gal does get away from him. I sha’n’t worry
over it.”</p>

<p>“I will manage it so carefully that not one in this village—be
his skin white or red—will be able to trace us,” said Kate,
proudly.</p>

<p>“I’ll back you ag’in’ the whole Shawnee nation for woodcraft,”
said Kendrick, with evident pride.</p>

<p>“I do not think that you would have cause to regret your
confidence.”</p>

<p>“Then your plan is to make the gal think that you are taking
her back to the station; then, when you get her into the
thicket, you’ll settle her for this world?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Kate, coldly; not a tone of her voice trembled
as she spoke.</p>

<p>“<em>Won’t</em> Girty swear when he finds that his little gal has absquatulated
and nary sign of her left!” and Kendrick chuckled
over the idea.</p>

<p>“I care nothing for his anger; besides, he will not be apt to
suspect that I had a hand in her escape.”</p>

<p>The two then returned to the village.</p>

<p>Girty had little idea that his prey was in danger of slipping
from his grasp.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE VENGEANCE OF THE RENEGADE.</span></h2>


<p>All was bustle in the Indian village, for word had gone
forth to make ready for the war-path! Gayly the braves donned
the war-paint, and sharpened the scalping-knives and glistening
tomahawks.</p>

<p>Girty had been summoned to the lodge of Ke-ne-ha-ha.</p>

<p>The great chief of the Shawnee nation, smarting over his
failure to destroy the dreaded Wolf Demon, panted eagerly
for the opportunity to lead his warriors against the pale-faces.</p>

<p>Girty recounted to the chief all that he had learned regarding
the strength of the settlers—knowledge that he had gained
in his recent scout to the other side of the Ohio.</p>

<p>The chief listened with a gloomy brow. His plan to surprise
the whites had failed.</p>

<p>“Since we can not creep upon them like the fox, our attack
shall be like the swoop of the eagle,” Ke-ne-ha-ha said,
at length.</p>

<p>“The chief will attack Point Pleasant first?” Girty asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; we will cross the Ohio above the pale-face lodges;
then my warriors shall form a circle around the long-knives,
reaching from river to river. The circle shall be a line of fire,
breathing death to the pale-face that dares to attempt to
cross it.”</p>

<p>“And the expedition will move to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have dispatched my fleetest runners to my brothers,
the Wyandots and the Mingoes, telling them that the war-hatchet
is dug up, and that, like the storm cloud, the red-men
are about to burst in arrows of fire upon the pale-faces, and
drive them from the land that the Great Spirit gave to the Indian.”</p>

<p>“I will prepare at once for the expedition,” Girty said, in
savage glee, his soul gloating over the prospect of slaughter.
Then he withdrew from the wigwam.</p>

<p>As Girty proceeded in the direction of his own lodge he
met Kendrick.</p>

<p>“Blood ahead, hey?” Kendrick said, as they met.</p>

<p>“Yes; to-night we take up the line of march.”</p>

<p>“And where are you going now?”</p>

<p>“To see my captive.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with the gal?”</p>

<p>“Make her my prey,” Girty said, and a look of savage triumph
came over his dark face as he spoke.</p>

<p>“That’s your vengeance, hey?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What wrong can rankle more keenly in the breast
of General Treveling than the knowledge that his cherished
daughter is my slave, the creature of my will?” said Girty,
fiercely.</p>

<p>“You’re a good hater,” Kendrick said, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Yes, or my hate would not have lasted all these years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Why, man, I hate this Treveling as bitterly now as I did
years ago when the lashes cut into my back. I swore once
that I would have his life, but that is poor and paltry vengeance
compared to that I have heaped upon his head.
First I stole his eldest daughter—then a mere child—and left
her to perish in the forest, and now I have taken his other
daughter from him. The second blow is worse than the first,
for death is far better than the fate that is in store for Virginia.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose you’ll let him know in some way of what you’ve
done?” Kendrick said.</p>

<p>“He already knows that the death of his eldest daughter
lies at my door; knows, too, that I have carried off this one,
but he does not yet know the fate that I have marked out for
her,” Girty replied.</p>

<p>For a moment Kendrick was silent; then he suddenly broke
into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Why do you laugh?” asked Girty, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“You’ve fixed this matter out all straight, hain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p>“S’pose a bullet from one of the settlers’ long rifles should
interfere with this hyer cunning plan, hey?”</p>

<p>“The bullet is not yet run that is to kill me,” rejoined
Girty, sternly.</p>

<p>“Not afeard, hey?”</p>

<p>“Not a whit.”</p>

<p>“Got a ’big medicine?’ as the Injuns say.”</p>

<p>“I do not fear death; that is my ’medicine,’” Girty replied,
carelessly.</p>

<p>“Well, I wish I was as sure of not going under as you are,”
Kendrick observed, with a grin.</p>

<p>“By the way, where is your daughter?” Girty asked.</p>

<p>“Inside the wigwam with the little gal,” Kendrick answered.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll visit the girl and let her know the fate that is
in store for her.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find my gal inside,” Kendrick said.</p>

<p>“I’ll be out in a few minutes; wait for me.”</p>

<p>Then Girty entered the wigwam that held Virginia a
prisoner.</p>

<p>As Kendrick had said, Kate was there in attendance on the
captive.</p>

<p>“Leave us for a little while, girl; I want to speak to the
lady alone,” Girty said.</p>

<p>Without a word, Kate left the wigwam.</p>

<p>Captor and captive were face to face.</p>

<p>The loathing that swelled in the heart of the girl was
plainly visible in her face as she looked upon the man who
had betrayed her into the hands of the savages.</p>

<p>“Do you know who I am, girl?” Girty asked.</p>

<p>“You are Girty, the renegade,” Virginia answered, calmly,
though every vein was throbbing with indignation.</p>

<p>“You are right. I am Girty, and the settlers call me the
renegade.”</p>

<p>“Yet I can hardly believe that you are that dreadful man.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because you have the face of a human, and his should be
the face of a wolf.”</p>

<p>Girty scowled, ominously, at the words.</p>

<p>“Keep your tongue within bounds, or it may be the worse
for you. Do you know where you are?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a prisoner in your hands,” Virginia answered, with
a look of settled despair.</p>

<p>“Do you know what your fate is going to be?”</p>

<p>“Death by some dreadful torture, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No, your guess is wrong; you are not fated to die yet.
Were you the captive of the Shawnees it is probable that you
would die at the torture-stake; but you are my prisoner; no
red brave holds your fate in his hands.”</p>

<p>“If report speaks true, I am the prisoner, then, of a man
whose nature is more cruel than that of the Indian,” said
Virginia, with spirit.</p>

<p>“I am merciless to those that brave my anger,” retorted
Girty, with a lowering frown.</p>

<p>“And how have I ever wronged you?” asked Virginia, in
wonder.</p>

<p>“You have never wronged me.”</p>

<p>“Why then have you torn me from home and friends?”</p>

<p>“You are the daughter of General Treveling?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I hate your father. Through you I strike at him. You are
dearer to him than even life itself. A blow dealt at you also
wounds him. That is the reason why I have lured you from
the settlement.” Fierce was the tone in which Girty uttered
the words, and a demon look of triumph gleamed in his dark
eyes.</p>

<p>Virginia listened in wonder. She had often heard her father
speak of the renegade, but always as a stranger.</p>

<p>“How has my father ever injured you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“How?” demanded Girty, in rising wrath. “The cut of
his lash has scarred my back. It happened long years ago,
but the memory is as fresh in my brain as though it were but
yesterday. I swore a bitter oath of vengeance. Years have
come and gone, but at last I strike, and the blow must reach
him through you.”</p>

<p>“This is a manly vengeance!” exclaimed Virginia, while
her lip curled in scorn. “If my father has wronged you, why
not seek him? Why select a helpless woman as your victim?
Is it because you are too cowardly to face my father?”</p>

<p>“Taunt on; you will repent these words in scalding tears
ere long,” said Girty, calmly.</p>

<p>“They speak truth in the settlement when they say that
you are like the wolf, both cruel and cowardly.”</p>

<p>“And before another week is gone, they will say, too, that
like the wolf, I love blood, for I will have rivers of it!” cried
Girty, savagely.</p>

<p>Virginia’s heart sunk within her as she looked upon the
angry face of the renegade.</p>

<p>“And now your fate; can you guess what it is to be?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No,” Virginia answered.</p>

<p>“You’re to be mine—my slave. This is the vengeance that
will scar your father’s heart and make him curse the hour
when he dared to wrong me!” Triumph swelled in the voice
of the renegade as he spoke.</p>

<p>Virginia—hapless maid—felt that she was lost indeed.</p>

<p>“Oh! why can I not die at once?” she murmured, in despair.</p>

<p>The renegade gazed upon his victim with a smile of triumph.</p>

<p>“First my vengeance, and then death can come to your aid
as soon as fate pleases. It will be rare joy for me to tell your
father of the shame that has come upon you. It is almost
worth waiting for all these years.”</p>

<p>“You are a wolf, indeed,” Virginia murmured, slowly.</p>

<p>“And who has made me so?” demanded the renegade,
fiercely. “Your father! His act drove me from the white cabins
to the wigwams of the savage; made me an outcast from my
race; a white Indian. May the lightning of the Eternal
strike me dead if I ever forget or forgive the injury that he has
done me. Even now—after all these years—the memory of my
wrong is as fresh in my brain as though it happened but yesterday.”</p>

<p>In a torrent of passion came the words from the lips of the
angry man.</p>

<p>Virginia shuddered at his manner.</p>

<p>“You have no pity?” she cried.</p>

<p>“Pity? No!” he said, with fierce accent. “Can pity dwell
in the heart of the wolf? Your father has made me what I
now am. Let him blame himself if the wolf he has created
rends his child.”</p>

<p>“I am entirely lost,” Virginia murmured, faintly.</p>

<p>“And now I go to take the war-path against the settlement—to
crimson with blood the waters of the Ohio. I will give
to the flames the cabins of the whites; the smoke of the burning
dwellings shall mark my course and attest my vengeance.
When I return, then—Well, my revenge will be made complete.
Let no vain thought of escape cross your mind, for I
shall leave you doubly guarded. There is no power on this
earth that can save you from me. Prepare, then, to meet your
fate with resignation. For the present, farewell.”</p>

<p>Then the miscreant left the lodge.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">A STRANGE STORY.</span></h2>


<p>In a tangled mass of bushes, near to the hollow oak that
the three scouts had selected as a meeting-place, Boone and
Kenton lay concealed.</p>

<p>They were waiting for the return of Lark.</p>

<p>“Strange, what can keep him?” muttered Boone, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you seen him at all?” Kenton asked.</p>

<p>“No, not since we parted.”</p>

<p>“It must be past twelve.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s been captivated by the red heathens,” Boone
suggested.</p>

<p>“That is possible,” Kenton replied.</p>

<p>“Shall we wait any longer?”</p>

<p>“Just as you say.”</p>

<p>“Hello! what’s that?” cried Boone, suddenly.</p>

<p>The scout’s attention had been attracted by a slight noise
in the wood beyond the little glade.</p>

<p>Eagerly the two listened.</p>

<p>Then, through the wood, with stealthy steps, came a dark
form.</p>

<p>It passed close to where the two whites lay in ambush.</p>

<p>Cold drops of sweat stood, bead-like, upon the foreheads of
the two scouts as they looked upon the dark form.</p>

<p>It was the Wolf Demon that was stealing so stealthily
through the wood.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem! did you see it?” muttered Boone, with a
shiver, after the terrible form had disappeared in the shadows
of the wood.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Kenton, in a solemn tone.</p>

<p>“What do you think it is?”</p>

<p>“It’s a spook, and no mistake,” Kenton said, with a shake
of the head.</p>

<p>“Well, it does look like it, don’t it?” Boone rejoined,
sagely.</p>

<p>“Yes. Why, they wouldn’t believe this if we were to tell
it in the station.”</p>

<p>“That’s truth; but seein’ is believin’, you know.”</p>

<p>“I think we may as well be going,” said Kenton, with a
nervous shiver, and a stealthy look around, as though he expected
to see a demon form in every bush.</p>

<p>“And not wait for Lark?”</p>

<p>“What’s the use? It will be morning soon. Ten to one
he has missed us and taken the back track to the station.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is likely. Let’s be going, then,” coincided
Boone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The two, carefully emerging from their covert in the
bushes, crossed the little glade and passed in front of the hollow
oak.</p>

<p>As they passed the tree, Kenton, who was a little in the
advance, halted suddenly and placed his hand in alarm upon
the arm of Boone.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Boone, quickly, in a cautious
whisper.</p>

<p>“Look there,” Kenton said, in the same low, guarded tone,
and, as he spoke, he pointed to the ground before him.</p>

<p>Boone, with straining eyes, looked in the direction indicated
by the outstretched hand of his companion.</p>

<p>On the earth before them was stretched a dark form.</p>

<p>Carefully, rigid as two statues, the two scouts examined
it.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” said Kenton, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“It’s a man, I think.”</p>

<p>“Can it be another victim of the Wolf Demon?”</p>

<p>“P’haps so; let’s examine it,” said Boone.</p>

<p>Then the two, stealing forward with stealthy steps, knelt
by the side of the senseless form. It was a man attired in the
forest garb of deer-skin. He was lying with his face downward.</p>

<p>The scouts turned him over, and then a cry of surprise
broke from their lips.</p>

<p>The man was Abe Lark.</p>

<p>“Lark, by hookey!” exclaimed Boone, in wonder.</p>

<p>“And hurt, too!” cried Kenton.</p>

<p>“It ’pears so.”</p>

<p>Then carefully they searched for the wound.</p>

<p>The search was fruitless. Lark was unhurt.</p>

<p>The two scouts looked at each other in wonder.</p>

<p>“Nary wound,” said Boone, tersely.</p>

<p>“What on yearth is the meaning of it?” questioned Kenton.</p>

<p>Boone shook his head in doubt.</p>

<p>Lark’s face was as white as the face of the dead, excepting
that part where the crimson scar traversed it.</p>

<p>Large drops of sweat stood upon the forehead of the senseless
man, and he breathed heavily, as if in pain. The veins,
too, of the forehead were swollen out like whipcords. All
gave evidence of great agony.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Kenton, puzzled.</p>

<p>“First, get him out of this faint,” replied Boone.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose is the matter with him?”</p>

<p>“It looks like a fit,” Boone said, thoughtfully. “P’haps
he’s seen that awful figure, and the spook cast a spell upon
him.”</p>

<p>To the superstitious minds of the borderers this seemed a
reasonable explanation.</p>

<p>“If I only had a little water now,” said Boone, looking
around him as if in search of some friendly spring.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a little flask of whisky,” and Kenton produced
it from an inside pocket of his hunting-shirt as he spoke.</p>

<p>“That will do fust-rate, but it’s kinder of a shame to waste
good liquor,” said Boone, with a comical grin, as he proceeded
to bathe the forehead of the senseless man with the whisky.</p>

<p>In a few moments a low groan came from the lips of Lark.
Then a convulsive shudder shook his massive frame.</p>

<p>“He’s coming to,” said Kenton, who was anxiously watching
the face of Lark.</p>

<p>“I knew the whisky would fetch him,” Boone remarked.</p>

<p>Lark’s eyes opened slowly, and with a bewildered expression,
like one in a maze, he gazed into the faces of the men
who knelt by his side.</p>

<p>“What the deuce is the matter with my head?” he muttered.</p>

<p>It was evident that his senses were still in a maze.</p>

<p>“He don’t know you,” said Kenton, in a whisper, to
Boone.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the other, in the same guarded tone; “he
hain’t fully recovered yet; hain’t got his mind right.”</p>

<p>Then again Lark, whose eyes had wandered off listlessly
in the forest, looked into the face of the man who bent so earnestly
over him.</p>

<p>A gleam of recognition came over Lark’s features. Feebly
he raised his hand to his head and passed it across his forehead,
as if by the act to call back his scattered senses.</p>

<p>“Kurnel Boone,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Yours to command,” replied Boone, with a hearty press
of Lark’s hand that lay by his side.</p>

<p>“And Kenton, too,” Lark continued.</p>

<p>“Right to an iota,” returned the borderer.</p>

<p>“What on yearth has been the matter with me?” and Lark,
with the assistance of Boone, rose to a sitting posture as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“That is what bothers us,” Boone said. “We have been
waiting for you to come for some time, as agreed upon; and
at last, growing tired of waiting, we concluded either that
you had been taken prisoner by the Shawnees, or else that
you had returned to the station, having missed us in the forest
in some way.”</p>

<p>A puzzled look appeared upon Lark’s face.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” he muttered, in doubt.</p>

<p>“Understand what?” Boone asked.</p>

<p>“Why, how I came to be here.”</p>

<p>Both Boone and Kenton looked at Lark in amazement.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” Boone asked.</p>

<p>“No,” Lark replied.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you hurt in some way?”</p>

<p>“Not as I knows on.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen any thing terrible for to skeer you?” and
the old hunter glanced nervously around as he spoke, as
though he expected to see the dreaded wood demon by his
side.</p>

<p>“No,” again replied Lark.</p>

<p>“Well, where have you been?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Again the two scouts stared at their companion in amazement.</p>

<p>“You don’t know?” Boone questioned, in wonder.</p>

<p>“No; I can’t remember any thing about it.”</p>

<p>“What have you been doing since we parted?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you that, either,” replied Lark, evidently as
greatly puzzled as the other two.</p>

<p>“Can’t tell?”</p>

<p>“No. I can remember parting with you here some hours
ago, and making the agreement to meet you here again. Then
I struck off into the forest, intending to scout into the Indian
village.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And that is all I can remember.”</p>

<p>“You don’t remember what you did after that?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing about it,” Lark replied, decidedly.</p>

<p>“Why, that was hours ago. I’ve been a prisoner in the
hands of the Shawnees, and escaped from them, too, in that
time,” Boone said.</p>

<p>“I can not explain; it is all a blank to me,” Lark replied.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you were taken with a fit?” suggested Kenton.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so.”</p>

<p>“But where have you kept yourself?—for I’ll swear that
you wasn’t hyer thirty minutes ago,” Boone said, decidedly.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it in the least,” Lark replied, rising to
his feet as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the most mysterious affair that I ever heerd of,”
Boone added, with a doubtful shake of the head. “How do
you feel—weak?”</p>

<p>“No, as strong and as well as I ever was.”</p>

<p>“It sounds just like one of the old hobgoblin stories that
my father used to tell by the fire on a winter’s night,” Boone
said, thoughtfully. “I allers thought that they were all lies,
but this story of yours is as strange as any of them.”</p>

<p>“It beats me,” Kenton observed.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s be going.”</p>

<p>And following Boone’s lead, they proceeded on their way.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">A STRANGE ATTACK.</span></h2>


<p>For a few minutes in silence the three proceeded on
through the forest. Boone was in the advance, Kenton followed,
and Lark brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Lark spoke.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute, kurnel.”</p>

<p>Astonished, both Boone and Kenton halted.</p>

<p>The party were just crossing a little glade, whereon the
moonbeams brightly fell.</p>

<p>As the two turned to Lark, they noticed that his face was
deadly pale—even whiter and more corpse-like than when he
was stretched senseless upon the sward. His lips were moving
convulsively.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Abe?” asked Boone, in alarm.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Lark, in guttural tones, and speaking
with evident difficulty.</p>

<p>Boone and Kenton exchanged glances of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel well?” Boone asked.</p>

<p>“No. I—I am deathly sick,” and, as the words came from
his lips, Lark sunk heavily to the earth.</p>

<p>Alarmed, his two companions knelt by his side.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem! You’re tuck bad,” said Boone, bending over
the fallen man.</p>

<p>“My strength is all leaving me,” murmured Lark, in anguish.</p>

<p>“And hain’t you been hurt at all?” asked Kenton, who could
not understand this strange sickness.</p>

<p>“No,” murmured Lark, speaking with great difficulty.</p>

<p>“Have you ever had one of these spells before?” said Boone,
fully as much puzzled as his brother scout to account for
Lark’s strange illness.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Lark, feebly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you have?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, what shall we do for you?” Boone felt a little relieved
in his mind by Lark’s words.</p>

<p>“Take me and bind me to the trunk of the largest tree that
there is near here.”</p>

<p>“Why?” cried Boone, in astonishment at the strange request.</p>

<p>“Bind you to a tree!” exclaimed Kenton, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Lark.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem! That’s odd treatment for a sick man,” said
Boone.</p>

<p>“It is the only way to treat my sickness,” replied Lark, in a
husky voice.</p>

<p>“You ar’n’t in earnest?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Boone could hardly believe his hearing.</p>

<p>“Tie you to a tree?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it must be a stout one,” murmured Lark.</p>

<p>“A stout one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, one that I can not pull up.”</p>

<p>“Pull up!” exclaimed both Boone and Kenton, in a
breath.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Lark, his breath coming thick and hard, like
the breath of a hunted animal.</p>

<p>“Pull up a tree! Why, you ain’t got strength enough now
to pull up a blackberry bush,” said Boone.</p>

<p>“That is true,” murmured Lark, hoarsely; “but in a few
minutes I shall have the strength of a giant.”</p>

<p>Again Boone and Kenton looked at each other in wonder.</p>

<p>“This is a riddle!” cried Boone.</p>

<p>“Do not waste time in trying to guess it,” gasped Lark,
hoarsely, “but, if you are friends of mine, do as I wish before
it is too late.”</p>

<p>“Too late!”</p>

<p>“Yes, a few minutes more and it will be too late. I have
had these attacks before, but never until this one did I guess
what the result of the attack would be. But, now, Heaven
has permitted me to have a knowledge of the truth.” Lark
spoke with great difficulty, and white froth began to gather at
the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>The two scouts looked upon the pain-distorted face of their
companion in horror.</p>

<p>“What on yearth is the matter with you?” exclaimed
Boone.</p>

<p>“Can’t you guess? Don’t you see it in my face?” Lark
gasped, in torture. “I am going mad.”</p>

<p>“Mad!” cried both the scouts, and they recoiled a step or
two in horror.</p>

<p>“Yes mad,” moaned Lark, in agony. “I can feel the madness
creeping over me; tie me to a tree, else I may injure you
or myself.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” cried Boone, impulsively. “Come, Kenton,
give me a hand!”</p>

<p>Then the two carried the helpless man to the foot of a stout
oak that grew by the side of the clearing.</p>

<p>With thongs cut from Lark’s hunting-shirt they bound him
securely to the tree. They placed him in an upright position
against the trunk of the oak.</p>

<p>“There, can we do any thing else for you?” asked Boone,
after the tying had been completed.</p>

<p>“No, except to remain near at hand and watch me. The
attack will not last long,” Lark replied. It was with great
difficulty that he spoke at all.</p>

<p>The scouts withdrew a short distance, and sitting down in
the bushes, watched their friend that they had bound so securely.</p>

<p>The moonbeams came down full on the head of the bound
man—upon the massive head that drooped so listlessly upon
the shoulder.</p>

<p>For fully ten minutes Boone and Kenton watched, and Lark
gave no sign of life.</p>

<p>Face and figure seemed alike a part of the tree.</p>

<p>“I say, kurnel,” said Kenton, in a cautious whisper, “what
do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” replied Boone, slowly; “it’s a most
wonderful affair. That a critter should be able to tell aforehand
that he was going to have a mad spell and want himself
tied up. Why, I never heerd of any thing like it.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t moved yet,” said Kenton, still watching Lark,
intently.</p>

<p>“P’haps he ain’t going mad after all?” suggested Boone.</p>

<p>“Or, it may be that he ain’t quite right in his mind now,
and the idea of his going mad is only one of the strange fancies
that sick people have sometimes?” queried Kenton.</p>

<p>“That’s sound sense,” rejoined Boone, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Then a slight movement of Lark’s head put a stop to the
conversation of the two scouts, and eagerly they watched the
man bound so tightly to the tree-trunk.</p>

<p>Lark raised his head slowly. By the light of the moonbeams
the two watchers could plainly see that it was deathly
pale. But they also noted a change in the face. The eyes,
which before had been lusterless and half-closed, were now
opened wide, and, seemingly, strained to their fullest extent.
They glared like eyes of fire—shone more like the eyes of a
wild beast than the orbs of a human.</p>

<p>“Look at his eyes!” said Boone, in a cautious whisper.</p>

<p>“They look as if they would pierce through a fellow!”
observed Kenton, in a tone of awe.</p>

<p>Carefully and searchingly Lark glared around him as if to
discover whether he was watched or not.</p>

<p>Then he essayed to move from the tree, but the bonds that
bound his hands and feet to the tree-trunk restrained him.</p>

<p>In amazement Lark looked down upon the fetters that impeded
his action.</p>

<p>“His memory’s clean gone,” said Boone, in Kenton’s ear.</p>

<p>“I do believe he <em>is</em> mad now,” observed Kenton, in a tone
of conviction.</p>

<p>“Yes, but look at him.”</p>

<p>Lark was carefully surveying the bonds that bound him to
the tree.</p>

<p>A moment or two his eyes glared upon the leathern fetters,
and then, with a desperate effort, he essayed to break
them.</p>

<p>The veins on his forehead knotted and swelled as he tugged
with almost superhuman strength, but the effort was useless.
He could not free himself.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem! ain’t that strength thar!” muttered Boone,
as he watched the tension of the thongs.</p>

<p>“They’re going to hold him, though,” replied Kenton, eagerly
watching the strange scene.</p>

<p>Again Lark glared around him, and again he tried to burst
the bonds that bound him.</p>

<p>The thongs cut into the flesh of the wrists, but he seemed
not to heed the pain. Every muscle in his huge frame was
brought into play.</p>

<p>Another mighty effort and the leathern thong burst as if it
had only been a band of straw!</p>

<p>“Talk about a giant—did you see that thong go?” exclaimed
Boone, in a guarded tone to Kenton.</p>

<p>“He snapped it like a pipe-stem.”</p>

<p>No look of triumph appeared upon Lark’s face as he
felt that his hands were free—only the look of fierce, settled
determination.</p>

<p>Again he glanced around the little opening as if in search
of watchers; then he proceeded to untie the lashings that
bound his feet to the tree.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the thongs dropped to the ground, and
Lark was at liberty.</p>

<p>He stepped from the side of the oak and drew himself up
proudly to the moonbeams, as if rejoicing that he was free.
All traces of his former feebleness had disappeared.</p>

<p>The two scouts watched his movements with anxiety.</p>

<p>Lark, pausing in the center of the little opening, fumbled
for a moment at his girdle.</p>

<p>“He’s looking for a we’pon,” said Boone, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes, it looks like it,” replied Kenton.</p>

<p>Then from his girdle Lark drew a keen-edged scalping-knife.
He tried the edge of the blade and the point, carefully,
upon his finger; then, with a grim smile of satisfaction,
he replaced the knife in his girdle.</p>

<p>Slowly, with cautious steps, Lark stole across the glade,
but on the borders of the wood he halted—paused for a moment,
irresolute, and then his strength seemed to fail him.
A deep groan of anguish came from his lips.</p>

<p>He tottered for a moment, as though striving by the mere
force of his will to keep his feet; then, with another groan,
deeper and more agonizing than the first, he fell heavily to
the ground.</p>

<p>Quickly Boone and Kenton left their covert in the thicket,
and hastened to his side.</p>

<p>Again he lay in a swoon, senseless, as before; the swollen
veins marked the white forehead, and the waxy drops of
perspiration formed a strange contrast.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE RETURN TO POINT PLEASANT.</span></h2>


<p>“Now I know what was the matter with him before!”
cried Boone, as he knelt by Lark’s side.</p>

<p>“One of these fits, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Slowly Lark’s scattered senses came back to him. With a
vacant look he gazed into the faces of the two men who knelt
by his side.</p>

<p>“By hookey, you’ve had a rough time of it,” said Boone.</p>

<p>“I have been out of my head, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mad as a March hare,” replied the borderer.</p>

<p>“Just look at the strips of deer-skin,” said Kenton, pointing
to the severed pieces lying at the foot of the oak. “You
bu’st ’em just as if they had been paper.”</p>

<p>“I feel weak enough now,” said Lark, sadly.</p>

<p>“No wonder!” exclaimed Boone, “you’ve used up all your
strength. Jerusalem! I thought you’d pull the oak over. I
shouldn’t like to have a tussle with you when you’re in one
of them queer fits like you had just now.”</p>

<p>Aided by his companions, Lark rose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>“I say, Abe, have you any idea what it is that makes you
act so queer?” Kenton asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; do you see this scar?” and Lark pointed to the terrible,
livid mark that disfigured his face.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Kenton replied.</p>

<p>“The wound that made that scar is the cause of it; that is,
I think it is. The wound affected my head. I have never
been the same man since.”</p>

<p>“It’s a mighty strange thing,” said Boone, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve had these spells before. I can always tell when
they are coming on. I have a strange, burning sensation in
my head; everything before my eyes is tinged with red; the
blood races like wildfire through my veins, then all my senses
leave me. I can remember nothing.”</p>

<p>“How did you receive the wound?” Boone asked.</p>

<p>“In an Indian fight. After it was given me I lay for days
between life and death. I escaped death, but the dark cloud
of madness follows me.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the queerest story that I ever did hear tell of,”
said Boone, sagely.</p>

<p>“How do you feel now?” asked Kenton.</p>

<p>“Oh, much better,” replied Lark.</p>

<p>“Strong enough for to go on?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Let’s be making tracks, then.”</p>

<p>Carefully and cautiously the three proceeded through the
thicket.</p>

<p>No hostile Indians barred their course, and by the time the
sun reached the meridian, the three entered the stockade that
fenced Point Pleasant.</p>

<p>Warm was the greeting that they received from the settlers,
but many a sun-bronzed cheek grew pale, and many a stout
heart beat quick when the scouts told the story of Ke-ne-ha-ha’s
expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>It was sad news indeed to the hardy borderers when they
learned that the great Shawnee chieftain had dug up the war-hatchet,
and would soon bring his painted warriors—hot for
slaughter—to the banks of the Ohio.</p>

<p>Then, too, for the first time, Boone heard the story of the
strange disappearance of General Treveling’s daughter, Virginia.</p>

<p>The rage of the old Indian-fighter knew no bounds when
he heard that the renegade, Girty, had abducted the girl.</p>

<p>“The eternal villain!” he cried, in wrath, “let me draw
‘bead’ on him once, and he’ll never carry off any other
white gal to give to the painted devils that he calls his brothers.”</p>

<p>The party headed by Jake Jackson, who had been in search
of traces of the missing girl, had returned to Point Pleasant
just before the arrival of the three scouts. Their search had
been fruitless; no traces of the missing girl had they discovered.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what it is, General,” said Boone to the aged
father, whose sad countenance showed plainly his deep grief,
“thar ain’t any use of looking for the gal, or that ’tarnal villain
either, in the timber ’bout hyer. He’s made tracks long
ago for the Injun settlement by the banks of the Scioto, Chillicothe,
as the red heathens call it.”</p>

<p>“But, colonel, can nothing be done to rescue her?” asked
the aged father, in despair.</p>

<p>“Why, General, you see it’s a bad time for to do any thing.
Within twenty-four hours the Injuns will be around us
thick as bees round a hive. We’ll have our hands full to attend
to the savages and keep their paws off our top-knots.
I feel right bad for you, General, but you know our first duty
is to the helpless she-critters and young ’uns hyer. We can’t
let ’em be massacred right afore our eyes, you know. We’ve
got to whip the red devils fust; then we’ll do what we can
toward saving your little gal.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Boone,” said the old soldier, sadly; “the
safety of the whole settlement can not be put in peril for the
sake of my private grief. I must bow in submission to the
will of Heaven, though my affliction is sore.”</p>

<p>“General, I feel for you, but duty you know is duty,” said
Boone, slowly.</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid that I should say a single word to swerve
you from the path of duty. I am too old a soldier to counsel
you to do wrong,” said the old man, quickly.</p>

<p>“Besides, General, I think about the best blow that we can
strike for your daughter’s rescue is to whip the red heathens
that are coming ag’in’ us. When we drive ’em back, then
we can follow them up, and perhaps be able to snake the
little gal out of their hands.” Boone was trying by his words
to lift the weight of sorrow that pressed so heavily upon the
heart of the old soldier.</p>

<p>The father shook his head sorrowfully. He had little hope
of ever seeing his daughter again.</p>

<p>He knew the nature of the red-men well. If defeated in
their attack on the station, they would be apt in their rage to
avenge their defeat by giving any helpless prisoner that might
be in their hands to the fiery torture of death at the stake.
No wonder that the father’s heart was sad.</p>

<p>“How many men have come in, Jake?” questioned the
old hunter.</p>

<p>“We’ve got nigh onto two hundred, all told,” replied the
sturdy Indian-fighter.</p>

<p>“Well, we ought to be able to whip a thousand of the red-skins,
easy,” said Boone, in a confident tone. “Do you expect
any more, Jake?”</p>

<p>“Not above half a dozen, kurnel; we’ve drawn ’bout all
our men in now,” Jackson replied.</p>

<p>“Set the women to running bullets, and get plenty of water
inside the stockade. The red heathens may make a siege
of it,” said Boone.</p>

<p>“Everything has been fixed, kurnel.”</p>

<p>“That’s pert. Now, Jake, I guess we three had better
take a little rest. We’ve been everlastingly tramping through
the timber. Throw out some scouts up the river to watch
for the red devils. After I’ve had an hour’s nap I’ll take to
the woods myself.”</p>

<p>Then Boone went to his cabin; he was followed by Kenton
and Lark.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s the matter with the stranger; did you
notice how pale he looked?” Jackson said, referring to Lark.</p>

<p>“Wal—yes, I did,” replied one of the settlers, who stood by
Jackson’s side. “I reckon they’ve had a putty tough tramp
onto it. Maybe, though, some on us will look white afore
we git through with Ke-ne-ha-ha and his Shawnees.”</p>

<p>Many an anxious face in the little group of men that surrounded
Jackson testified to the truth of the speaker’s guess.</p>

<p>In the cabin the three scouts stretched themselves upon the
bear-skins spread upon the floor, and soon were in the land
of dreams.</p>

<p>The hour’s nap of Boone had lasted some four hours, and
the shades of evening were beginning to gather thick about
the settlement when the old borderer awoke.</p>

<p>Boone rubbed his eyes and indulged in a prolonged yawn.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem! my eyes feel as if they were full of sticks,”
he muttered.</p>

<p>Then Boone cast his eyes through the little window that lit
up the cabin, to the sky.</p>

<p>“It’s late, too, by hookey!” he cried. “It’s time for us to
be on the look-out, for the red devils will probably try to cross
the Ohio some time after dark.”</p>

<p>Then Boone laid his hand upon Kenton’s shoulder.</p>

<p>The scout awoke instantly. His slumber was like the sleep
of a cat.</p>

<p>“Time for our scout, Kenton,” Boone said.</p>

<p>“All right; I’m on hand, kurnel. Shall I wake Lark?”
Kenton asked.</p>

<p>The third one of the scouts was still buried in heavy slumbers.</p>

<p>“Yes; he’ll be mad if we go without him, or at least, I
know I would be,” said Boone, with a chuckle. The stout
hearted borderer welcomed danger as he would an early
friend.</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll wake him, then.”</p>

<p>Kenton laid his hand upon Lark’s shoulder, but the sleeper
stirred not.</p>

<p>“Shake him a little,” suggested Boone.</p>

<p>Kenton did so, but the sleeping man never stirred.</p>

<p>“He’s laying himself right down to it, ain’t he?” said Boone,
with a dry humor in his voice.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better go without him?” asked Kenton.</p>

<p>“Try once more. He’s the soundest sleeper that I ever did
see,” Boone said.</p>

<p>Again Kenton shook the sleeping man, and this time violently,
but the effort was useless; Lark never moved.</p>

<p>Kenton bent over and examined him.</p>

<p>“He ain’t a-breathin’ right,” the scout said, in some little
alarm.</p>

<p>“Has he got another fit?” asked Boone, quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, it looks like it. His teeth are clenched together,
and he’s breathing like a quarter-horse.”</p>

<p>Boone knelt by Kenton’s side and bent over Lark.</p>

<p>A moment’s examination convinced Boone that there was
something the matter with his companion.</p>

<p>Lark’s breath came thick and hard.</p>

<p>“Another spell, by thunder!” muttered Boone, as, with
Kenton, he bent over the unconscious man.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, as though moved by some secret spring,
Lark’s eyes opened. He stared into the faces of the two that
bent over him, but his eyes were like eyes of glass; there was
no life therein.</p>

<p>Like men in a trance, Boone and Kenton gazed into the
white face and the great, staring eyes.</p>

<p>There was something in the face that seemed to chill the
very blood coursing in their veins.</p>

<p>For a moment Lark stared with meaningless eyes at the
two, and they, fixed as statues, horrified, they knew not at
what, returned the look.</p>

<p>Then, with a sudden start, and apparently with the strength
of a giant playing in his muscles, Lark sprung to his feet.</p>

<p>As he rose, he came in violent contact with Boone and
Kenton, and the sudden shock hurled them to the floor as
though they had been two children.</p>

<p>When he had gained his feet, Lark cast a rapid glance
around him, passed his hand mechanically across his forehead,
and then, with a stealthy step, like unto a wild beast
crawling in upon its prey, he left the cabin.</p>

<p>For a moment Boone and Kenton, seated upon the floor
where they had fallen, looked at each other in speechless
astonishment.</p>

<p>“If he ain’t mad, I’m a catfish!” cried Kenton.</p>

<p>“Let’s foller him; he may do some one a mischief!” exclaimed
Boone. Then, with eager haste, they followed Lark.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE PRICE OF LE-A-PAH’S HAND.</span></h2>


<p>The shades of night descended upon the village of Chillicothe,
yet the plumed and painted warriors headed by Ke-ne-ha-ha
went not forth upon their expedition against the whites
on the banks of the Ohio.</p>

<p>The red chieftain fumed and chafed like a caged lion. His
allies, the Wyandots and the Mingoes, had sent word that
they could not move their forces for three days, and so, despite
his desire for war, he was compelled to remain inactive.</p>

<p>The wily sachem knew full well that he could accomplish
nothing unless he came down upon his foes in overwhelming
numbers.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha had faced the deadly fire of the white rifles on
many a bloody field. He had felt the prowess of the hardy
bordermen, and had learned to respect it. No hot-headed
boy was he, to rashly dare the power of the white-skins, without
a force far superior to their own.</p>

<p>And so he waited, and while he waited—furious as the
angry bear cheated of his prey—he called down the curses of
the Great Spirit upon the heads of the slow-moving chiefs,
his allies.</p>

<p>He paced restlessly up and down the narrow confines of his
wigwam.</p>

<p>“The chiefs of the Wyandots and the Mingoes are like turtles;
they should have houses on their backs. A warrior
should be like the eagle or the hawk—swift as the forked light
of the Great Spirit. The white-skins must know that the
red-men will soon take the war-path against them. The great
chief, Boone, has long ears. Like a fox he crept into the
Shawnee village; he will carry back to his people the news
that the red warriors are arming for the fight.”</p>

<p>The meditations of the chief were interrupted by the entrance
of his daughter, Le-a-pah.</p>

<p>The features of the chieftain softened as he looked upon the
handsome face of his only child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“May Le-a-pah speak with her father, the great chief?”
asked the girl, with a timid smile.</p>

<p>“The heart of the father is always open to the words of
his child,” replied the chief, drawing the little form of the
girl to him as he spoke, and smoothing back the dark masses
of ebon hair from her low forehead.</p>

<p>“Will my father be angry if Le-a-pah speaks straight?”
and the girl looked shyly into her father’s face as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Let my daughter speak; the chief will not be angry at
his singing-bird, because her tongue is not forked,” said Ke-ne-ha-ha,
tenderly.</p>

<p>“My father is the great chief of the Shawnee nation; will
my father be angry if his child has looked upon a young
brave with loving eyes?”</p>

<p>An earnest look the chief cast into his daughter’s face.</p>

<p>“The singing-bird wishes to leave her father, then?”</p>

<p>“Did not the mother of the singing-bird leave her father
when she came to sing in the lodge of the great chief?” the
maiden asked, shyly.</p>

<p>“My daughter speaks straight. It is the course of nature.
The leaf falls from the tree and seeks the embrace of the earth.
What is the name of the chief in whose wigwam Le-a-pah
would sing?”</p>

<p>“He is only a young brave,” began the girl, timidly.</p>

<p>“Youth is not a crime,” interrupted the chief; “nor would I
give my child to a brave whose hairs are like the snow in
color. Spring should not sit in the lap of Winter, else her
blood will be chilled into ice—it is bad.”</p>

<p>“The young brave is not yet a great warrior, but he has a
heart as big as a bear, and no white plume is bound up in his
scalp-locks. He will be a great chief when years come heavy
upon his head,” said the girl, cheered by the encouraging
words of the great chief.</p>

<p>“Let my daughter speak his name, and then Ke-ne-ha-ha
will know how to answer,” said the father.</p>

<p>“He is called the White Dog,” and then the girl gazed anxiously
into her father’s face, but the face of the chief was like
a face of marble; not a muscle moved as the name of his
daughter’s lover fell upon his ears. Even the keen womanly
instinct of Le-a-pah, now made doubly keen by the fires of
love burning so intensely in her bosom, could not detect
whether her father was pleased or displeased.</p>

<p>“The young warrior that captured the great white fighting-man,
Boone?” said the chief, slowly.</p>

<p>The heart of the girl leaped for joy; she thought the speech
of her father an omen of good.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, joyously, and the warm blood leaped
freely into her cheeks.</p>

<p>“The young brave is very young,” said the chief, gravely.
But the heart of the girl could not be deceived. Her heart
had told her that her father approved of her choice.</p>

<p>“Le-a-pah is young, too,” replied the girl.</p>

<p>“The chief is new on the war-path.”</p>

<p>“Yet, alone he grappled with the great white hunter, and
brought him to the earth. What other red warrior has ever
done the like?”</p>

<p>A grim smile crept over the stern features of the chief as
he listened to the unanswerable words of the girl.</p>

<p>“My daughter is as wise as the fox—she speaks for her lover
as stoutly as the she-wolf fights for her young.”</p>

<p>“The great chief is not angry at Le-a-pah because she
speaks for the man she loves?”</p>

<p>“No; it is the blood of Ke-ne-ha-ha running in the veins
of Le-a-pah that bids her speak.”</p>

<p>“My father will then give his consent that the young chief
shall claim Le-a-pah as his own?”</p>

<p>“Ke-ne-ha-ha will then be alone in the world. The Red
Arrow, his eldest joy, lies beneath the big oaks that sway
their leafy branches in the woods of the Scioto valley. It is
the will of the Great Spirit—the chief will not murmur
at it.”</p>

<p>“Then Le-a-pah may go and sing in the lodge of the young
warrior, and make glad his heart?” asked the girl, her heart
swelling with joy.</p>

<p>“Yes—on one condition,” replied the chief.</p>

<p>“And what is that?” asked the girl, puzzled.</p>

<p>“The chief must first know. If he accepts the condition and
performs the service asked, then Le-a-pah shall be his wife,
and Ke-ne-ha-ha will himself give her into his hands.”</p>

<p>The look of joy upon the face of the girl amply repaid the
father for his kindly words.</p>

<p>“Ke-ne-ha-ha too is growing old. In years to come he
will be too old to lead the Shawnee warriors to battle. His
feet will be feeble upon the war-path and his sight will be
dim. The Shawnees will select a new chief to lead them.
Who so fit as the son-in-law of their old sachem, if Ke-ne-ha-ha
lifts up his voice in his favor?”</p>

<p>The heart of the girl beat high with pride as she listened to
the words of her father and thought of the future that looked
so bright before her.</p>

<p>“Le-a-pah can not speak as she would, for her heart is too
full.”</p>

<p>“Let my daughter send the young chief to me. Ke-ne-ha-ha
will tell him of the service that he must attempt in order to
win the flower of the Shawnee tribe.”</p>

<p>“It is a service of danger?” and a look of anxious fear
swept over her dark face.</p>

<p>“If the flower is not worth the winning, no chieftain’s
hand shall ever pluck it from the parent stem,” replied the
father.</p>

<p>“The young brave will face a thousand deaths, Le-a-pah
will pledge her life for it,” said the girl, promptly, and then
she left the wigwam.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the young warrior who aspired to the
hand of the great chieftain’s daughter stood within the lodge
of the great chief.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha cast a searching glance into the frank and
open face of the young Indian. Therein he saw written both
courage and skill.</p>

<p>“The young brave would have the daughter of Ke-ne-ha-ha
to sing in his wigwam?”</p>

<p>“The chief speaks straight,” replied the young warrior,
firmly.</p>

<p>“The love of a pure girl is priceless; no treasure like it on
the earth; it is the greatest blessing that Manitou ever gave
to his red children. What will the young warrior give or do
to win the singing bird?”</p>

<p>“He will give his life for Le-a-pah; do all possible things.
Let the chief speak—tell of the service that he wishes the
young warrior to do,” said the Shawnee, promptly.</p>

<p>For a moment Ke-ne-ha-ha looked into the face of the
young brave as though pondering upon the words that he was
about to speak.</p>

<p>The warrior waited anxiously, impatient to know of the
deed that he must do to win the girl that he loved so fondly.</p>

<p>“The chief has heard of the Wolf Demon?” asked Ke-ne-ha-ha.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the warrior, and a look of dread crept over
his face as he heard the name of the terrible scourge of the
Shawnee nation.</p>

<p>“The paws of the Wolf Demon are red with the blood of
my people. Many Shawnee warriors have fallen by the
tomahawk of this terrible being. On their breasts he cuts his
totem—a Red Arrow. Does the chief know why the totem
of the Demon is a Red Arrow?”</p>

<p>“No,” the warrior replied.</p>

<p>“The Red Arrow was the eldest daughter of Ke-ne-ha-ha—the
sister of Le-a-pah. She left her tribe to dwell in the
wigwam of a white stranger. Ke-ne-ha-ha followed and
struck to the death the false girl who forsook her tribe. He
killed also the white skin. The dead white was eaten up by
a wolf, but the soul of the white-skin lived. It eat up the
soul of the animal, and the beast became the Wolf Demon—a
wolf with a human soul. The Wolf Demon can be killed.
Ke-ne-ha-ha has grappled with him. He did not clutch
air but substance. The human wolf can be struck to the
death if the blow be given rightly.”</p>

<p>The words of the great chief opened the eyes of the young
brave. He guessed what the service was that the Shawnee
chieftain wished at his hands.</p>

<p>“Let the great chief speak of the deed that must be done
to win the hand of Le-a-pah.”</p>

<p>“The human wolf can be killed—”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Let my young brave try to kill the Wolf Demon. If he
draws one drop of blood from the scourge of the Shawnees,
he shall have the daughter of Ke-ne-ha-ha.”</p>

<p>A look of fierce determination settled upon the face of the
young warrior.</p>

<p>“The Shawnee warrior accepts the offer,” he said, firmly.
“He will seek for the Wolf Demon in the wood. He will
search for him as the panther searches for the red chief that
steals its cub. If mortal hands can take the life of the
Shawnee terror, then he shall fall by the knife of the White
Dog.”</p>

<p>“It is good!” cried Ke-ne-ha-ha, and a look of satisfaction
came over his face. “Let the young warrior perform the
service and the great chief of the Shawnee nation will give
him his child.”</p>

<p>“The White Dog will seek the Wolf Demon at once.”</p>

<p>Then the warrior turned upon his heel and left the wigwam.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">DEATH OR FREEDOM.</span></h2>


<p>While the great Shawnee chieftain was stating to the
anxious lover the condition that covered the gift of his
daughter’s hand, another strange life drama was being enacted
in the Indian village.</p>

<p>Kendrick—the renegade—and his daughter—the Kanawha
Queen—stood together by the wigwam that held in its confines
the helpless prisoner, Virginia Treveling.</p>

<p>Before the door of the lodge sat a brawny Shawnee brave,
placed there by Girty to watch the prisoner.</p>

<p>The dark-browed renegade had taken ample measures to
hold his victim, securely, in his power.</p>

<p>First, Kate guarded the prisoner; second, the Indian warrior
kept ward and watch.</p>

<p>No thought of the prisoner’s escape ever crossed the mind
of Girty. He, too, like the Shawnee chieftain, Ke-ne-ha-ha,
chafed at the delay of the expedition against the whites.</p>

<p>The renegade was fully as eager as his red brother for the
banquet of blood. He longed to see the smoke of the burning
dwellings cloud the face of the sky, and to wet his knife
in the warm life-blood.</p>

<p>Kendrick had just explained to his daughter the reasons
that led to the delay of the expedition.</p>

<p>Kate listened attentively, her brain busy in thought.</p>

<p>“And when will the expedition move?” she asked.</p>

<p>“That’s duberous, gal,” he answered. “It all depends upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the Wyandots and the Mingoes. When they send their
warriors, then we kin go ahead, but not till then.”</p>

<p>“And my plan, father, to remove this girl from my path?”</p>

<p>“You had better carry it out right away,” said the renegade,
after thinking for a moment. “Thar’ll be no better
chance than at the present. I owe Girty a little balance,
which I reckon this affair will settle. Instead of staying
with his own tribe, the Wyandots, he’s been sneakin’ round
hyer with the Shawnee. If it goes on, he’ll have more influence
hyer than I have, and I ain’t a-goin’ to stand that,
nohow. So, gal, if you want any help to snake the gal out
of his clutches, I’m the critter for to give it to you, and no
mistake.”</p>

<p>“I may need your aid, father,” said the girl, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“All right, you kin have it. I’d do most any thing to spite
him.”</p>

<p>“I think that it will be better to carry the girl off to-night.
He may place her in some safer place to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Jest so; thar’s no tellin’; he’s as suspicious as a crow.
It will worry him some to lose the gal,” said Kendrick, with
a grin.</p>

<p>“But the Indian sentry before the door of the wigwam?”
and, with her eyes, Kate indicated the brawny warrior, who,
seated before the lodge-door, was smoking a rude pipe, fashioned
from a corn-stalk, with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Oh, I kin fix him easy ’nough,” replied Kendrick.</p>

<p>“Then I will make the attempt at once,” said Kate, decidedly.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix the Injun. You go into the lodge. I’ll talk
to the chief and get him to leave his post for a moment.
When he’s gone, I’ll cough; then, you slip out of the lodge
with the gal and take to the timber. It ain’t likely that they
will be apt to discover that the gal is gone till morning.”</p>

<p>“And by that time it will make very little difference whether
it is discovered or not,” said Kate, meaningly.</p>

<p>“Are you going to kill the gal?” asked Kendrick, speaking
as coolly and as unconcerned as though it was the killing of
some worthless beast that he referred to.</p>

<p>“Why should I let her live?” asked Kate, fiercely. “Is
she not loved by the man whom I love better than I do any
one else in this world?”</p>

<p>“But if you leave her hyer with Girty—”</p>

<p>“May she not escape from him?”</p>

<p>“That’s true; but dead—”</p>

<p>“She can not return.”</p>

<p>“That’s true; ag’in.”</p>

<p>“Once in the forest, dead, a prey to the wolves, she never
more will rival me.”</p>

<p>“Wal, I don’t know but what I like it better that way myself.
It’ll worry Girty, and that will jest suit me,” said Kendrick,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I’ll enter the wigwam at once and prepare the girl.”</p>

<p>“And arter you go in I’ll tackle the Injun. I’ve got an
idea for to git shet of him. When I cough, you’ll know that
he’s out of the way, and that you kin fetch the little gal
out.”</p>

<p>So without further words, Kate left her father and entered
the lodge. Kendrick waited until she was fairly inside, and
then he walked, leisurely, to the Indian on guard and sat
down by his side.</p>

<p>The brawny chief acknowledged the approach of the renegade
with a nod of recognition.</p>

<p>“Ain’t this kinder dull work for my brother?” asked the
renegade.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” and the Indian gave vent to a grunt of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>“You’d rather be on the war-path ag’in’ the white-skins
along the Ohio than to be hyer, a-keepin’ watch over a
squaw?”</p>

<p>“My brother speaks straight,” said the Indian, in a surly
tone, taking the pipe from his lips for a moment.</p>

<p>“Pity we can’t go on the war-trail, hey?”</p>

<p>“Big pity,” replied the chief, sententiously.</p>

<p>“My brother thinks much of his Wyandot brother, Girty?”
said Kendrick, in a tone of question.</p>

<p>“His Wyandot brother is a great warrior,” replied the chief,
evidently not willing to commit himself by a decided answer.</p>

<p>“Wal, I judged that you thought a heap of him by being
willing to do his watching, hyer,” said Kendrick, suggestively.</p>

<p>“Girty is a great Wyandot chief, but the Shawnee brave is
not his watch dog for love. The chief does a service, but the
chief will be paid for it.”</p>

<p>“Oho!” muttered Kendrick, to himself, “I reckon I know
how the chief is a-going to be paid.”</p>

<p>“My brother knows now that the Shawnee chief is to be
paid for his service,” said the Indian.</p>

<p>“No more than right,” said Kendrick, heartily. “I heerd
the other day that Girty got some corn-juice from a flat-boat
that he captivated on the Ohio.”</p>

<p>“Wah! it is good. The Shawnee brave is to have corn-juice
in payment for his service.”</p>

<p>“Wal, corn-juice ain’t bad to take when it’s good,” said
Kendrick, reflectively.</p>

<p>“It is good!” replied the warrior, decidedly.</p>

<p>“I wish my wigwam wasn’t so far off,” said Kendrick,
with a sly look into the Indian’s bronzed features as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“Why does my brother wish that?” asked the chief.</p>

<p>“Wal I feel thirsty, and I’ve got some of the best corn-juice
that you ever see’d in my wigwam, and I’m too ’tarnal
lazy to go after it.”</p>

<p>“It is bad,” said the warrior, slowly, looking askance at the
renegade.</p>

<p>“If my brother did not have to watch the wigwam he
could go for the corn-juice and we would drink it together.”</p>

<p>“My brother speaks straight.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry the chief can not go—”</p>

<p>“Why can not the chief go?” asked the Indian, within
whose breast there had sprung up a desire to taste the precious
fire-water of the renegade.</p>

<p>“Is he not watching the wigwam for his Wyandot brother
Girty?”</p>

<p>“Can not the Shawnee chief go for the fire-water, and leave
his Shawnee brother to watch the lodge?” asked the Indian.</p>

<p>Of course this was exactly what the shrewd renegade
wished.</p>

<p>“My brother is as wise as the fox.”</p>

<p>The Indian bowed at the compliment.</p>

<p>“Will my Shawnee brother go for the fire-water and leave
me to watch the lodge?”</p>

<p>“My brother speaks good. The chief will go,” and the Indian
rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“The chief will find the corn-juice under a blanket near the
door of the lodge.”</p>

<p>The Indian bowed gravely, and departed.</p>

<p>“He’d smell it out, anyway,” muttered Kendrick; “leave a
red-skin alone for finding whisky, if thar’s any around. They
go for it quick es a coon does for a tall tree when the dogs are
arter him. Now I’ll jest warn Kate, so that she will know
that the coast is clear. I reckon Girty will swear some when
he finds that the gal has broke for tall timber,” and the renegade
chuckled in glee.</p>

<p>His fit of laughter over, he looked about him carefully. No
one was in sight; so he cautiously gave the signal agreed upon
between Kate and himself.</p>

<p>A few moments after the sound of the cough died away on
the night air, Kate came cautiously from the wigwam, followed
by Virginia.</p>

<p>“All right, gal,” said the renegade, quickly. “The Injun’s
out of the way, but don’t let grass grow under your feet between
hyer and the Ohio. They may diskiver that you’ve cut
your stick any moment.”</p>

<p>“Do not worry, father; I know every foot of the ground
between here and the river,” replied the girl, a strange nervousness
patent in her voice. “Come, lady; do not fear; before
this night is over, you shall be free from danger.”</p>

<p>“Thar ain’t much danger in the grave,” muttered the renegade
between his teeth.</p>

<p>Then Kate led the way into the wood, and Virginia followed
without a word.</p>

<p>The renegade watched them until the dark shadows of the
forest closed around them and they were hid from his view.</p>

<p>“I reckon my little gal will fix her,” muttered the renegade,
in a tone of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Then a thought flushed suddenly across his mind. With a
sudden spring he leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>“By all the imps below, I never thought of that before!”
he cried, excitedly. “Shall I foller and stop ’em?” and he
took a few steps toward the wood, as if to execute the purpose.
“But no, why should I?” and he halted. “One don’t
know it, and the other don’t either. It can’t be a crime if she
don’t know what she’s doing in killing this gal.” And then
another thought came into his mind. The dull-witted renegade
was getting strangely bright.</p>

<p>“The gal has fooled me! I remember now that she once
told me that Miss Treveling was the only woman in the world
that had ever spoken a kind word to her, and that she would
willingly lay down her life for her sake. The truth on’t is,
that she has sneaked the gal out of our hands to save her.
The lover story was all moonshine. Wal, let the gal do it, if
she kin. She little knows what she is doing when she saves
this she-critter.”</p>

<p>Then the renegade resumed his place by the lodge.</p>

<p>In a short time the Shawnee returned with the gourd bottle
of whisky.</p>

<p>It only took a few minutes for the renegade and the chief
to empty the gourd.</p>

<p>Hardly had they finished the whisky when from the darkness
came Girty.</p>

<p>Girty said but a few words to the two and then entered the
lodge.</p>

<p>“There’ll be a hurricane ’fore long,” muttered Kendrick.</p>

<p>The renegade was right, for Girty rushed from the wigwam,
furious as the panther cheated of its prey.</p>

<p>“Curses on you, the gal is gone!” he cried.</p>

<p>The Indian looked the astonishment he felt, while on Kendrick’s
face was a look of amazement, of course assumed for
the occasion.</p>

<p>“You have left your post,” Girty cried to the Indian.</p>

<p>The chief did not attempt to deny it, but strove to excuse
himself by stating that Kendrick had watched in his place.</p>

<p>Girty guessed the scheme at once.</p>

<p>“You eternal villain!” he cried, addressing Kendrick; “it
was all contrived between you and your daughter to rescue
the girl from my hands, you lying hound!”</p>

<p>Enraged, Kendrick rose to his feet, drew his knife and made
a dash at Girty, but his opponent was quicker far than he,
for, as Kendrick advanced, Girty dealt him a terrific blow
with his tomahawk that felled him like a log to the earth.</p>

<p>“Lie there and rot!” cried Girty, contemptuously. “And
now summon the warriors; we must follow our birds at once.
As for this affair, you can bear witness, chief, that I struck
him in self-defense.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Within five minutes, a dozen painted warriors, headed by
Girty, were on the trail of the fugitives.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">FOLLOWING A MADMAN.</span></h2>


<p>With eager haste, Boone and Kenton followed in the footsteps
of Lark.</p>

<p>On through the station, without turning to the right or
left, but heading straight toward the forest, Lark went.</p>

<p>Amazed at his strange action, they strove to overtake him,
but the madman—for the two borderers had but little doubt
that Lark had been attacked by sudden madness—entered
the shadows of the wood before the others could overtake
him.</p>

<p>The two paused on the edge of the timber and looked at
each other for a moment in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Well, dern my old hide, ef I know what to make of this!”
exclaimed Boone, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>“Shall we follow him?” asked Kenton.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Boone, decidedly. “I never see’d anything
like this hyer afore, and I feel a nat’ral curiosity to see the
end onto it. We were a-goin’ to make a scout, and ef we foller
him, why, it’s pretty much the same thing.”</p>

<p>So, without further conversation, the two plunged into the
wood.</p>

<p>They tracked Lark easily, for he crashed through the wood
without caution, making fully as much noise as a huge bear.</p>

<p>Lark was heading straight for the Ohio; in fact, retracing
the course the three had taken in coming from the Indian village
of Chillicothe.</p>

<p>“Ef we should happen to run into a war-party of Shawnees,
they’d make mince-meat out of us afore you could say
Jack Robingson,” growled Kenton to Boone, as they raced
through the tangled mazes of the thicket, in their endeavor to
keep up with the madman’s headlong course.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s lucky that thar ain’t any chance of meetin’ the
red heathens this side of the big drink.” Boone was referring
to the Ohio.</p>

<p>“Derned ef I ain’t gitting short-winded,” said his companion,
breathing heavily.</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t got any more wind than I want myself,”
Boone replied.</p>

<p>Still onward through the forest Lark went, never slacking
his headlong speed, stopping not for bush nor brier.</p>

<p>At last he reached the river’s bank.</p>

<p>The shades of night were descending fast upon the earth,
covering forest and river with a mantle of inky blackness.
Afar off in the eastern sky, the moon, like a sword of fire,
was rising above the forest’s dark line.</p>

<p>Calmly on rolled the great river, its turbid waves lashing
the banks that bound its pathway with many a dull and sullen
moan as though impatient of restraint.</p>

<p>When Boone and Kenton reached the river’s side, Lark had
just drawn a canoe from its hiding-place in the bushes that
ringed the bank. The canoe was the same that the three had
used before when they had crossed the stream.</p>

<p>Lark dragged the canoe to the river and launched the frail
bark on the dark and sullen waters.</p>

<p>The two scouts, profiting by the delay, overtook Lark just
as he gave the canoe to the embrace of the dark stream.</p>

<p>“Hallo, man! what on yearth has got into yer?” cried
Boone.</p>

<p>For the first time, Lark turned and looked upon his pursuers.</p>

<p>One look the hardy bordermen took at the face of their
companion, and then they felt that the warm life current in
their veins was congealing with horror.</p>

<p>They looked not upon the face of a man, but rather on the
face of a corpse, newly risen from its grave.</p>

<p>White as the stainless marble was the face of Lark, and his
large eyes glared with demoniac fires.</p>

<p>Like men inspired with sudden fear, the stout-hearted borderers
recoiled.</p>

<p>Then, to their amazement, Lark raised his hand and pointed
to the canoe, that rocked and danced like a thing of life upon
the turbid waters.</p>

<p>“He wants us for to git in and cross the ‘drink’ with him,”
said Boone, in a voice that showed plainly the feeling of horror
that had taken possession of the old Indian-fighter.</p>

<p>“Shall we go?” asked Kenton, scarcely speaking above his
breath.</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s our duty as Christian men to see that this madman
comes to no harm. I’m afeard that we are a-goin’ to
see something terrible,” Boone answered.</p>

<p>Again, and with a gesture of command, Lark pointed to
the frail boat, that was dancing like an eggshell on the bosom
of the surging tide.</p>

<p>The two obeyed the gesture and entered the canoe.</p>

<p>Then Lark seized the paddle, and the little craft, with its
human freight, sped rapidly across the river.</p>

<p>The white-capped billows—the children of the wind—surged
and dashed against the sides of the canoe as if eager to
tear from their frail shelter the mortals that dared to risk their
lives amid the turbid waves of the Ohio.</p>

<p>The rising wind whistled and surged through the frail forest
trees; the waves were turbid and angry; the moon, a ray
of lurid light, was darting lambent fires through the dark
cloud-banks.</p>

<p>The scouts looked around them and shuddered. A terrible
depression was upon their feelings. The very air they
breathed seemed full of evil.</p>

<p>The bow of the canoe touched the bank.</p>

<p>With a sweep of the broad paddle, Lark brought the canoe
sideways to shore. Boone and Kenton at once gained the
bank. Lark followed slowly.</p>

<p>On the bank Lark halted. In his hand he held the
“painter” of the canoe, a sprig of grapevine.</p>

<p>A moment he looked at the trail bark and then deliberately
drove his foot through the bottom and cast it adrift to the
mercy of the swollen waters.</p>

<p>Eagerly, like living things, the sullen waves leaped over and
around the canoe as it sunk from mortal sight in their chill
embraces.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem! how on yearth are we a-goin’ to git across the
drink ag’in?” muttered Boone, in dismay.</p>

<p>Kenton did not reply, for he was watching Lark eagerly.</p>

<p>The stalwart borderer, who was acting so strangely, watched
the canoe until the dark waters hid it from his sight. Then,
without paying any more attention to the two who stood by
his side on the bank, than if they had been sticks or stones,
he plunged into the thicket that fringed the river’s side.</p>

<p>Utterly dumbfounded at his unaccountable actions, Boone
and Kenton again followed on his track.</p>

<p>This time, however, Lark did not proceed carelessly and
without caution, as before, but, on the contrary, crept through
the tangled underwood with all the care of a wild beast
stealing upon its prey.</p>

<p>The two woodmen had but little difficulty in following their
strange companion.</p>

<p>Seconds lengthened into minutes, minutes into hours. The
great moon, rising slowly up, no longer flecked the sky with
swords of fire, but beamed a flood of soft, silvery light, save
when the flying clouds crossed her path, and, like agents of evil,
hid her rays from sight.</p>

<p>“We must be near Ke-ne-ha-ha’s village,” muttered Kenton
to Boone, after a weary tramp through the pathless wilderness,
trailing Lark’s erratic course.</p>

<p>“Putty near,” replied Boone.</p>

<p>Hardly had the words left the lips of the old woodman
when, as suddenly as if he had sunk into the earth Lark disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p>The woodmen stood aghast. They had followed Lark
easily. He had not seemed to notice that the two were near
him, and had not attempted to evade them.</p>

<p>“Where on yearth <em>has</em> he gone to?” muttered Boone, in
astonishment, and rubbing his eyes as if he doubted the evidence
of his own senses.</p>

<p>“Down into the yearth or up into the air,” answered Kenton,
who was as much astonished as his companion at the sudden
and mysterious disappearance.</p>

<p>Then the two advanced to the spot whereon Lark had
stood when they had seen him last.</p>

<p>It was too dark for them to attempt to follow his trail, if
he had left one, and so, defeated in their pursuit, they halted
to counsel what their next move should be.</p>

<p>“Let’s go on a little way; maybe we’ll find some trace of
him ahead,” said Boone, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Then the two proceeded onward till they came to a little
open glade, whereon the moonbeams shone.</p>

<p>As the two reached the glade and stood within the timber
that fringed its edge, a slight noise fell upon their ears.</p>

<p>“Hush!” cried Boone, in a cautious whisper, and he laid
his hand lightly upon Kenton’s arm as he spoke.</p>

<p>Stout Sim hardly needed the caution, for his quick ear had
caught the sound.</p>

<p>“It’s some one coming through the forest,” said Kenton, in
a whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Boone, listening intently.</p>

<p>“Can it be Lark?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” said the old woodman; “it’s more
likely to be an Injun. We must be mighty nigh to the Injun
village.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ve run into a hornet’s nest,” said Kenton,
coolly.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to git out, then,” observed Boone, nothing terrified.</p>

<p>“Whoever it is, he don’t seem to be afeard of any thing,
for he’s marching right along as if he owned the hull
wood.”</p>

<p>“Let’s to timber,” said Boone, curtly.</p>

<p>A second more and the stalwart forms of the two scouts
had disappeared. Like snakes they nestled in the grass and
waited for the man who walked through the wood so carelessly.</p>

<p>The two did not have long to wait, for the sound of the
steps grew louder and louder, and then an Indian warrior,
decked in the gaudy war-paint and prepared for battle, stepped
into the little glade whereon the moonbeams shone.</p>

<p>In his hand the warrior carried a tomahawk. The moonbeams
danced upon the edge of the steel.</p>

<p>The warrior paused in the center of the glade and looked
around him as though expecting some one. Then he spoke,
defiantly:</p>

<p>“I am the White Dog, a great brave of the Shawnee nation.
I seek the Wolf Demon in the forest. If he has a heart
as big as a weasel’s, he will come from his lair and face
me.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">A JOYOUS MEETING.</span></h2>


<p>Virginia followed Kate without fear.</p>

<p>Once within the wood, Kate enjoined caution upon her
companion.</p>

<p>“It is a long and weary way from here to Point Pleasant,”
she said.</p>

<p>“I have traversed it once already, then a prisoner. It will
not seem so long now, for I know that each step is taking me
nearer to my dear home and those I love,” Virginia replied,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>Kate looked at the fair girl, a mournful smile upon her
olive-tinged features.</p>

<p>“And you trust yourself fearlessly in my hands?” Kate
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, why should I fear?” Virginia said, in a tone of wonder.</p>

<p>“Am I not the daughter of a renegade?” Kate asked, a
world of bitterness in her tone.</p>

<p>“You are not answerable for the faults of others,” Virginia
said, gently. “I freely trust my life in your hands and I
have no fear.”</p>

<p>They were proceeding rapidly through the wood as they
spoke.</p>

<p>Kate did not reply aloud to Virginia’s speech, but to herself
she murmured:</p>

<p>“Would this girl trust me if she knew how deeply I loved
the man that possesses her heart?”</p>

<p>Kate led the way at a swift pace—not that she feared pursuit,
for she did not dream that Virginia’s escape, and her
own treachery toward the renegade Girty, would be discovered
until the morning.</p>

<p>Virginia, both in her face and dress, showed visible traces of
the peril that she had passed through.</p>

<p>Well was it for her that her gown was of stout homespun
stuff, for many a thorn-bush laid hold of it in her quick passage
through the wilderness.</p>

<p>“Where will you go first, to the station of Point Pleasant or
to my cabin, where Harvey Winthrop is?” Kate asked.</p>

<p>“Is not your cabin some miles beyond the station?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but from the route I am obliged to take, my cabin is
but a short distance further than the station.”</p>

<p>“Let us go there first, then,” said Virginia, eagerly. “Oh!
the anguish I have suffered, thinking him dead,” and a cloud
came over the fair face of the girl as she spoke.</p>

<p>Every word that Virginia spoke in reference to Winthrop,
touched Kate to the quick, for she saw how deeply and truthfully
she loved him. Then she realized, too, how hopeless
was the passion that burned so fiercely in her own bosom.
But, neither by word or sign, did she betray that love to Virginia.</p>

<p>Steadily Kate pursued her course, heading direct for the
Ohio; and, without a murmur at the toilsome way, cheered
by the thought that a few hours would give her to the arms
of both lover and father, Virginia followed.</p>

<p>Leaving the two girls, so strangely unlike in station and in
nature, to pursue their tedious journey through the wilderness,
they little thinking that the fierce renegade, Girty, had
discovered their escape, and with a chosen band of Shawnees
was following hard upon their track, we will return to the
man whom Girty had stricken to the earth, Dave Kendrick,
the renegade.</p>

<p>The Indians bore the wounded man to his lodge, and examined
his wound.</p>

<p>The blow had been a fearful one, and Kendrick’s time on
earth was short.</p>

<p>When the renegade recovered from his faint, it did not
take him long to discover that he had not many minutes to
live.</p>

<p>“The skunk has finished me,” he muttered, with a deep
groan of pain. “I haven’t got many minutes more of life,
but I’d give ’em all to have a single chance at him,” and then
the stricken man ground his teeth together fiercely.</p>

<p>“My brother is hurt much?” said one of the warriors, bending
over him.</p>

<p>“The happy hunting-grounds for me, chief, afore I’m an
hour older,” replied Kendrick, with a gasp of pain. “The
cursed skunk—to use his tomahawk ag’in’ my knife,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Can Noc-a-tah do any thing for his brother?” said one
of the Indians, a tall chief who was one of the principal men
among the Shawnees.</p>

<p>For a few moments Kendrick was silent, apparently overcome
by pain; then, with a great effort, he rallied his scattered
senses.</p>

<p>“Yes, chief, you kin do something for me. I want to
make a ‘totem.’ Bring me two pieces of bark and a pointed
twig.”</p>

<p>One of the Indians departed and speedily returned with two
pieces of white birch-bark and a pointed twig.</p>

<p>“That’ll do,” muttered Kendrick, faintly. “I reckon I’ll
get even with the skunk now.”</p>

<p>Then, the renegade dipped the pointed twig in the blood
that was flowing freely from the terrible wound in his head,
and with great difficulty—for Dave Kendrick had little of the
scholar about him—he traced some half a dozen lines on the
smooth surface of the two pieces of birch-bark. On both
pieces he wrote the same words, and then sunk back, exhausted.</p>

<p>The breath of the renegade came thick and hard. The icy
fingers of Death already were closing upon and chilling their
victim.</p>

<p>“Chief,” he muttered with a gasp, “one of these totems
to the man who wounded me, Girty; the other to the white-haired
chief, General Treveling, at Point Pleasant—you know
him?”</p>

<p>The savage bowed assent.</p>

<p>“Tell him the totem is true—a dying man swears to it—how
cursed dark it is; I—” and then, with a stifled groan,
Dave Kendrick, the renegade, sunk back, dead.</p>

<p>Noc-a-tah, the Shawnee chieftain, carefully rolled up the
two pieces of bark that bore on their smooth surface the “totems,”
thrust them into his pouch, and then departed to fulfill
the mission of the renegade.</p>

<p>We will now return to the fugitives.</p>

<p>Kate and Virginia paused not, either for food or sleep, but
through the darkness of the night steadily pursued their way.</p>

<p>To Kate, the forest—although to strange eyes a trackless
wilderness—was as familiar as her own little garden. She
knew the way as well in the darkness as in the light. She
was, in very truth, a child of the wilderness, and from infancy
she had traversed freely the brown paths of the wild
woods.</p>

<p>The first light of the morn was lining the eastern skies with
leaden and white purple rays when Kate and her companion
came within sight of the little cabin that was the home of the
Kanawha Queen.</p>

<p>A weary march it had been through the live-long night,
and Virginia, her garments wet with dew, and torn in many
places by the rough grasp of the brambles, that had sought
to stay her progress through the thicket, presented but a sorry
sight.</p>

<p>Her hair, too, escaped from the simple knot that usually
held it in its place, streamed down over her shoulders in wild
confusion. Her face was pale, save where a hectic spot burned
in either cheek. Her eyes, though, shone with a determined
light, for Virginia, weak woman as she was, held
within her veins the stern soldier blood of her father. That
blood had nerved her to face the peril that she had encountered.</p>

<p>“There, lady, is refuge at last,” said Kate, pointing to the
humble cabin.</p>

<p>“A palace could not be more welcome than your cabin,”
said Virginia, gratefully, and a joyous light sparkled in her
eyes as she spoke.</p>

<p>The two advanced to the house. The door sprung open
as if by magic, and on the threshold stood Harvey Winthrop.</p>

<p>With a cry of joy, Virginia rushed into his arms and sunk
almost fainting upon his breast. She was in the arms of the
man she loved; she thought only of that and of naught else.</p>

<p>Winthrop folded the slender form of the girl to his heart,
and tenderly brushed the damp dew from her shining locks.</p>

<p>Kate turned her head aside. She could not bear to look
upon the meeting of the lovers. Their joy tore her heart and
made the life-blood in her veins run chill with agony.</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven! give thy poor handmaiden strength to bear
her cross,” she murmured, in despair. And as she spoke, a
sudden faintness came over her; all things swam before her
eyes, and but for the support of the rude fence by which she
stood, she would have fallen.</p>

<p>The lovers wrapped up in the joy of each other’s presence,
did not notice her agitation.</p>

<p>“Again I hold you in my arms,” the young man said, softly,
as he strained the loved form of the maiden to his heart.</p>

<p>“And I thought you dead,” Virginia said.</p>

<p>“To Kate I owe my life!” And as he spoke, both he and
Virginia turned their eyes toward the Kanawha Queen.</p>

<p>By this time Kate had recovered her composure, except that
her cheek was paler than it was wont to be.</p>

<p>“To Heaven your thanks, not to me, its humble instrument,”
replied Kate, modestly.</p>

<p>Then the three entered the cabin.</p>

<p>A cheerful fire blazed in the broad fire-place. By the fire,
the three sat.</p>

<p>Kate, clad in buck-skin, Indian fashion, showed few traces
of the terrible night-journey, but Virginia, although clad in
stout homespun garments, had many a mark of bramble and
brier; yet, to the eyes of Winthrop, she looked prettier than
ever.</p>

<p>“And your wound?” asked Virginia, suddenly remembering
her lover’s hurt.</p>

<p>“I scarcely feel it now,” Winthrop replied; “a few hours
has worked wonders. The thought of your danger troubled
me more than the pain of my wound.”</p>

<p>“And from that danger, Kate has saved me, although at the
risk of her own life,” and Virginia cast a glance full of love
and thankfulness toward the daughter of the renegade.</p>

<p>“I did what was but my duty to do. I promised to save
you if I could. I kept that promise—”</p>

<p>“At the risk of your own life,” Virginia said, quickly.</p>

<p>“The life of the outcast is worth but little,” Kate replied,
sadly.</p>

<p>“The life of my sister is as precious as my own!” Virginia
exclaimed, earnestly, and rising, she knelt by Kate’s side and
folded her arms around her.</p>

<p>“Your sister!” said Kate, in wonder.</p>

<p>“Yes; for henceforth you shall be my sister. Kate, you
must forsake this wild life and make your home with me.
Will you not do so?”</p>

<p>Virginia looked, pleadingly, in the face of Kate, and wondered
to see her brown cheek pale and her great eyes fill with
tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, you do not know what you ask!” cried Kate, in agony,
“and I can not tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Virginia heard the strange words in amazement.</p>

<p>“Can you not be my sister?”</p>

<p>“No, no, it is impossible,” Kate murmured, sadly.</p>

<p>“Impossible, why?”</p>

<p>“Because—”</p>

<p>The wild war-whoop of the Shawnees, pealing forth on the
still morning air, and ringing in the ears of the three like a
signal of doom, cut short Kate’s words.</p>

<p>Then the door yielded to a heavy blow, and a score of dark
forms rushed into the room.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE TOTEM OF THE RENEGADE.</span></h2>


<p>A single glance at the dark forms that filled the doorway,
and the hearts of the three sunk within them.</p>

<p>They were prisoners to the Shawnees!</p>

<p>At the head of the painted warriors was Simon Girty, the
renegade.</p>

<p>Girty’s eyes lit up with fiend-like joy as he gazed upon his
captives.</p>

<p>“A keen she-devil you are, to snatch the game out of my
hands; but did you think that you could escape from me so
easily?” he cried, addressing Kate.</p>

<p>The warm blood flushed the face of the “Queen,” as she
listened to the insolent words of the white Indian.</p>

<p>“You are in my power; no human force can snatch you
from me,” he continued, exultingly. “A nice trick it was, to
pretend to watch my prisoner for me, and then aid her to escape
in the darkness! But I tracked you, though, cunning as
you are. A fit daughter of a worthy father; but, maybe, my
turn will come now, Chiefs,” and he turned to the warriors
that filled the doorway, “which of you want this dainty
brown maid for a squaw? I’ll give her to one, for her fate is
in my hands now.”</p>

<p>All the fire in Kate’s nature shone in the lurid flash of her
dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Take care, Simon Girty!” she cried, in anger. “If my
father is not man enough to protect me from insult, my rifle
will.”</p>

<p>“Your father is dead, girl, or mighty near it,” returned
Girty, scornfully. “When I discovered the trick that you
and he played upon me, I sunk my tomahawk in his skull and
let out his fool’s brains.”</p>

<p>“My father slain!” cried Kate, in horror.</p>

<p>“I reckon that there isn’t much life left in him by this
time. He dared to cross my will, the hound that he was, and
I struck him to his death,” said Girty, fiercely.</p>

<p>Kate felt that she was indeed at Girty’s mercy.</p>

<p>“And for you, my pretty white bird,” and the renegade
turned to Virginia as he spoke, “did you fancy that you could
escape the fate that I marked out for you? You will learn in
time that my blows seldom fail.”</p>

<p>“Oh, have you no mercy!” cried Virginia, in despair.</p>

<p>“What mercy did your father have when his lashes tore my
back, long years ago?” demanded the renegade, fiercely.
“The mercy that he showed to me I will show to him and his.
I’ll tear his heart as his punishment tore my flesh. When he
learns your shameful fate, then, and not till then, will the
debt of vengeance be canceled. How he will curse his evil
fortune when he learns that his dainty daughter—the apple
of his eye, the pride of his old age—is the victim of the renegade,
Simon Girty!” and then he laughed loud and long.</p>

<p>“Accursed villain!” cried Winthrop, suddenly, unable to
restrain his fury; and quick as thought, he flung himself upon
the renegade, regardless of the overpowering number of foes
that surrounded him.</p>

<p>With a single heavy blow between the eyes, he beat the
renegade, like a log, to the ground; but ere he could pursue
his advantage further, the Shawnee warriors dashed themselves
upon him. Ten to one, Winthrop was speedily overcome
and securely bound.</p>

<p>The renegade rose to his feet, his eyes gleaming like a demon’s,
and a livid mark upon his face, where the knuckles of
the young man had bruised the skin.</p>

<p>“You shall pay dearly for that blow!” Girty cried, between
his clenched teeth. “You shall die at the torture-stake, a
thousand deaths all in one. The tomahawks of the Indians
will cut your flesh from your bones, even while you are a living
man. You will cry aloud for death to come to end your
misery. And in your last moments the thought will come
that this fair girl—whom I guess you love—will be wholly in
my power—a helpless victim to my caprices. And as you die
in lingering torments, I will stand by your side and taunt you
till death releases you from my power.”</p>

<p>Words can but feebly describe the waked wrath of the
renegade.</p>

<p>Winthrop faced him undauntedly.</p>

<p>“It suits your cowardly nature better to taunt a helpless
prisoner than to face a free man. I do love this girl, and
the thought that she is helpless in your power, demon that you
are, gives me greater pain than can all the fire and torture of
the red devils with whom you claim kindred. I am your captive.
Look well to me; see that I do not escape from you, for
it would cost you your life if I should ever again regain my
freedom.”</p>

<p>Every muscle in the young man’s form swelled with indignation
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“When you cease to be my captive, death will claim you,”
replied Girty, grimly.</p>

<p>Kate looked around her. She saw no avenue of escape.
She felt that they were hopelessly lost.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Girty; “but first bind the wrists of these
two squaws.”</p>

<p>The Indians obeyed his order.</p>

<p>“Now for your future home, the Shawnee village!” Girty
cried, in triumph.</p>

<p>The Indians and their prisoners, led by the renegade, passed
through the door of the cabin and stood within the little clearing
that surrounded the house.</p>

<p>Then forth from the timber came the Shawnee brave, Noc-a-tah.</p>

<p>He came straight to Girty.</p>

<p>“Well, chief, what is it?” asked the renegade. He conjectured
from the Indian’s manner that he was the bearer of
some important tidings.</p>

<p>“Your white brother has gone to the land of shadows—he
sends this totem to you.” Then the Indian drew from his
pocket the piece of birch bark whereon Kendrick had, with
his blood and the pointed twig, traced his dying words.</p>

<p>“Dead, eh?” said Girty, with a sneer. “A totem to me?
What can it be?”</p>

<p>Then the renegade took the piece of bark and endeavored
to read the lines.</p>

<p>Rudely were the letters formed, for Dave Kendrick could
boast of but little scholarship.</p>

<p>The renegade puzzled over the writing. Suddenly the
meaning flashed upon him. A gleam of fierce joy swept over
his dark face.</p>

<p>“By all the fiends, this is double vengeance!” he cried in
glee. “Chief, in Chillicothe, thou shalt have the best scalping-knife
that I own, in payment for this precious totem.”</p>

<p>Noc-a-tah gravely nodded, and then disappeared within the
thicket.</p>

<p>Girty turned to where the two girls stood, side by side.</p>

<p>The maidens wondered at his searching look.</p>

<p>“What a blind idiot I have been not to have noticed it before,”
he muttered, “and yet I remember, now, the face of
the girl did look familiar to me when I first saw her in the
Shawnee village. To think of my vengeance slipping through
my fingers, and then, after long years, being put again within
my hands! There’s fate in this. And Kendrick, too—he
thought, by this dying declaration, to strike a blow at me,
even from the grave. He thought both the girls were safely
out of my hands. He little dreamed when I should read his
‘totem’—as the savage termed it—that the two he referred
to in it would be helpless prisoners in my power. Could he
have foreseen that, he would have cut off his hand rather
than divulge to me what he has here written.”</p>

<p>Then the renegade laughed long and silently. His captives
wondered at his glee.</p>

<p>“You risked your life to save this girl; why did you do it?”
he asked of Kate, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Because she was helpless in the power of a cruel monster.
My heart told me to save her, even at the risk of my own
life,” replied Kate, promptly.</p>

<p>“And you, girl—are you not grateful to this maiden, who
has tried so hard to save you from me?” he said to Virginia.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am <em>very</em> grateful,” replied the girl, wondering at
the question.</p>

<p>“Their hearts don’t tell ’em,” muttered the renegade.
“The old adage is a fable; blood is <em>not</em> thicker than water.
Virginia, years ago I stole your eldest sister, and left her to
perish in the forest. This was the first blow that I aimed at
your father. Now see how strangely fate sometimes disposes
of things in this world. The child that I left to die did not
die, but was saved, and has grown to womanhood, and I all
the time thinking her dead. Girls, can’t you guess the truth?
The man that saved and reared the child was Dave Kendrick,
the renegade!”</p>

<p>The truth flashed upon the maidens in an instant.</p>

<p>“Sister!” cried Virginia, warmly; but the bonds upon their
wrists forbade further greeting.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is your sister. Kate, you are Augusta Treveling,
the eldest daughter of the old General,” said Girty, and a triumphant
smile was upon his face.</p>

<p>The smile made the two girls tremble.</p>

<p>“The hound that I gave to the worms never told the secret
to me, but, dying, he wrote it here on this piece of bark.
This was his vengeance,” and Girty laughed loudly. “It
will be pleasant news to the old General, your father, when
he hears that both of his daughters are living, and both are in
my power.”</p>

<p>“Oh, man, have you no mercy?” plead Kate.</p>

<p>“Mercy?” cried the renegade, fiercely. “Ask it of the
hungry wolf, the angry bear, or the red savage, when his
knife is raised to slay! Expect mercy from all these, but expect
none from the man whose skin is white but whose heart
is red. Come; in Chillicothe you will meet your fate.”</p>

<p>A broad sheet of flame, springing from the woods to the
north of the little clearing, followed by the sharp report of a
dozen rifles, answered the boast of the renegade.</p>

<p>Of the ten savages who had followed Girty’s lead, seven
lay wounded or dead upon the earth.</p>

<p>From the timber came the ringing shout of the borderers,
and a score or more of the settlers, headed by General Treveling
and stout Jake Jackson, came with a rush into the clearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Girty, though badly wounded, and the unhurt savages, had
fled at once.</p>

<p>Jake and fully one-half of the borderers followed in pursuit.</p>

<p>The captives were speedily released from their bonds.</p>

<p>“Let me give thanks to that Heaven that in its bounty has
seen fit to give me back both my daughters to gladden the
last years of an old man’s life!” cried Treveling, in joy, as he
folded his children to his heart.</p>

<p>The timely arrival of the settlers was easily explained.
Noc-a-tah, the Shawnee chief, had faithfully kept the promise
made to the dying renegade, and had first sought Point Pleasant
and given the “totem” into the hands of the General.</p>

<p>The father’s joy on learning that his eldest daughter lived
can easily be imagined.</p>

<p>Jackson, who had seen the Indian depart, instantly counseled
that he should be tracked, that the whereabouts of the
rest of the Shawnees might be discovered.</p>

<p>The advice of the stout Indian-fighter had been followed,
and the happy result was, the rescuing of Girty’s victims.</p>

<p>Well might the aged father lift up his voice in joy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL"></a>CHAPTER XL.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE WHITE DOG AND THE WOLF DEMON.</span></h2>


<p>“He’s a plucky young cuss, ain’t he?” said Boone, in a
whisper to Kenton, when he heard the bold defiance of the
Indian warrior.</p>

<p>“The Wolf Demon will make mince-meat out of him ef
he puts his claws onto him,” replied Kenton, in the same
cautious whisper that Boone had used.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the spook will come?” said Boone.</p>

<p>“I reckon not; them things never come when they’re expected.
They alers take their own time,” returned Kenton.</p>

<p>“How easy we could ‘rub’ him out now, eh?” Boone observed,
suggestively.</p>

<p>“I’m afeard it would bring a hull grist of his relations
down on top of us, thick as skeeters in a swamp,” said Kenton.</p>

<p>“That’s so.”</p>

<p>A movement on the part of the Indian put a stop to their
conversation, and eagerly they bent their eyes upon him.</p>

<p>After pronouncing his war-like defiance, the warrior, with
his tomahawk in one hand and his keen-edged scalping-knife
in the other, remained motionless as a bronze statue.</p>

<p>Full five minutes he waited.</p>

<p>His eager eye, quick and piercing as the eye of a hawk,
surveyed the forest before him.</p>

<p>He heard each rustling leaf that stirred in obedience to the
soft night-wind’s commands; the noise of the pinions of the
owl, winging its nocturnal flight through the dim aisles of the
great, green wood; the cry of the tree-toad; the chirrup of
the cricket, deep down in the earth. But, none of these stirred
the senses of the Indian. He knew the voices of the
night full well, for he was a child of the forest and had slept
many an hour beneath the shadows of the spreading boughs.</p>

<p>He listened for a sound that he heard not—the tread of the
great gray wolf, who wore the face of a man.</p>

<p>Impatient, the warrior uttered a guttural exclamation.</p>

<p>Again he addressed the silence and the gloom, called for
the dread being to appear, at whose approach all living things
of the earth or air fled.</p>

<p>“The warrior is weary of waiting. If the Wolf Demon is
in the thicket let him come forth. The White Dog will strip
off his hide, or else the Wolf Demon shall take his scalp and
mark the totem of the Red Arrow on his breast.”</p>

<p>But the silence and the gloom replied not to the bold defiance.</p>

<p>After a pause of a few moments the warrior uttered a contemptuous
exclamation.</p>

<p>“The Wolf Demon should wear the skin of the muskrat;
he skulks in the dark and fears to meet his foe face to face.”</p>

<p>The chief turned upon his heel and thrust his scalping-knife
into his girdle as if to depart.</p>

<p>One single step he made, and then a sound fell upon his ears
that made him pause; made him draw the keen-edged knife
again from his belt; made him prepare for battle.</p>

<p>The quick ear of the Indian—trained from infancy to note
the noises of the forest, the plain and river—heard a stealthy
step prowling through the thicket.</p>

<p>The noise came from behind him. Quick as thought the
warrior turned and faced the point from whence the noise
proceeded.</p>

<p>No form stepped from the timber into the little glade, whereon
the soft moonbeams fell, but the Indian still heard the
sound of the stealthy steps.</p>

<p>The steps seemed to come no nearer, and yet the sound
grew no fainter.</p>

<p><em>Whoever was within the wood was circling around the Indian
as if to attack him in the rear, and by surprise.</em></p>

<p>The chief guessed the truth, and as the unknown foe moved,
he moved. Slowly he turned, keeping his face always in the
direction from whence came the sound of the steps.</p>

<p>The two borderers, concealed in the thicket, watched the
movements of the Indian with astonishment.</p>

<p>When he assumed the attitude of defense and drew again
the knife, Boone nudged Kenton.</p>

<p>“He hears something,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“’Pears like it,” Kenton replied.</p>

<p>And as they watched the Shawnee, they, too, heard the sound
of stealthy steps approaching them.</p>

<p>They noted that, as the steps approached, the face of the
chief seemed to follow the direction of the steps.</p>

<p>At once the Indian-fighters guessed the truth; guessed that
the terrible Wolf Demon, lurking in the thicket, was circling
around the chief, eager to spring upon him unawares.</p>

<p>The stealthy steps came nearer and nearer to the concealed
men.</p>

<p>Boone, stretched out so near to Kenton that he touched him,
felt that the stout borderer was trembling like an aspen
leaf; and, to speak the truth, the blood in Boone’s veins was
running cold with horror.</p>

<p>There, not a dozen paces from them, within the thicket, they
saw the terrible form of the Wolf Demon.</p>

<p>With stealthy step he moved through the wood, his eyes
glaring, like coals of fire, upon the Indian warrior. In his
paw he carried the fatal tomahawk that had brained so many
Shawnee chieftains.</p>

<p>The terrible form was moving in a circle around the warrior.
But the Indian was on his guard, and, guided by the
sound of the stealthy steps, kept his front always to his foe.</p>

<p>The Wolf Demon completed the circle, and then, as if fully
satisfied that he could not take the warrior by surprise, came
slowly from the thicket and stood within the open space; not,
though, in the soft light of the moonbeams, but half hid by
the shadows thrown by the forest monarchs that hemmed in
the little glade.</p>

<p>The keen eyes of the Indian detected the appearance of the
terrible form.</p>

<p>The light of fierce determination shone upon the face of the
Shawnee warrior, and firmly he grasped his weapons and
waited for the onset of the foe.</p>

<p>Boone and Kenton, in breathless suspense, watched from
their leafy covert, eager to see the issue of the contest that
was, apparently, so near at hand.</p>

<p>A few seconds only the Wolf Demon paused within the
friendly shadows of the wood; then, with the swiftness of
forked lightning, he leaped upon the Shawnee warrior.</p>

<p>Bravely the Indian met the assault. With his tomahawk
he parried the blow aimed at his head, and, at the same moment,
drove his long knife, up to its haft, in the side of the
phantom foe; but, the glittering blade met no flesh in its passage,
and not a single drop of blood dimmed the brightness
of the steel.</p>

<p>The thrust of the Shawnee chieftain cost him dear, for, ere
he could withdraw his knife again, the tomahawk of the Wolf
Demon descended upon his head. By a quick motion of his
own ax he partly parried the blow, but the force of the stroke
bore him over backward to the earth.</p>

<p>With a howl of triumph the Wolf Demon planted his foot
upon the warrior’s breast, and the glittering tomahawk gleamed
before his eyes, raised to give the death-blow.</p>

<p>The warrior felt that he was lost.</p>

<p>The death-note of his nation broke from his lips.</p>

<p>Then, forth from the timber, from the direction in which the
Indian village lay, came the Shawnee girl, Le-a-pah.</p>

<p>She had arrived upon the scene of conflict just in time to
witness the discomfiture of her lover.</p>

<p>With outstretched arms and a cry of horror—regardless of
her own life—she rushed forward to save her lover from the
edge of the fatal tomahawk, which was raised to drink his
blood.</p>

<p>The paw of the Wolf Demon which clutched the tomahawk
remained poised in the air as the girl advanced. The blow
descended not upon the unprotected head of the prostrate
man.</p>

<p>The phantom form, motionless as one of the forest oaks,
glared upon the Indian girl with its eyes of fire as if struck
dumb with horror.</p>

<p>It was a startling tableau.</p>

<p>The scouts looked on with awe-struck eyes. They expect
each instant to see the tomahawk descend, and the Indian
girl fall lifeless at the blow.</p>

<p>Steadily for a few moments the Demon form glared at the
girl, and then, taking its foot from the breast of the down-trodden
chief, it retreated backward with slow steps, toward
the forest, still, however, keeping its eyes upon the face of
the girl as though under the influence of some terrible enchantment.</p>

<p>The Indian chief, hardly able to realize that he was saved
from the death that but a moment before seemed so certain,
made no effort to rise, but appeared transfixed with horror.</p>

<p>The Wolf Demon gained the shadow of the thicket, and
then—as if the spell that had bound him had been broken—with
a terrible cry, that rung through the forest like the wail
of a lost soul, doomed forever to eternal fires, he vanished
amid the darkness.</p>

<p>The cry of the Wolf Demon froze the blood of his hearers
with horror.</p>

<p>The girl, with a sob of terror, sunk down by the side of the
young chieftain.</p>

<p>Rising, the Shawnee warrior tenderly lifted the light form
of Le-a-pah from the greensward.</p>

<p>“Light of my heart, thou hast saved the life of the red
chief!” cried the warrior.</p>

<p>“Le-a-pah could not bear the thought that her lover should
seek the terrible Wolf Demon in the wood; she followed in
his track to urge him to return,” said the maiden.</p>

<p>“The White Dog has tried to win Le-a-pah. If he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
failed to kill the Wolf Demon, it is because the Great Spirit
wills that he shall not die by the hand of a red-man.”</p>

<p>“Let us seek my father. I will beg him to release you
from the cruel task.”</p>

<p>Then the chief and the maiden left the glade.</p>

<p>After a few minutes Boone and Kenton came from their
hiding-place.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s look for Lark,” said Boone. “I’ve a thought
that he has met this terrible Wolf Demon when he was hyer
afore, and that the sight has made him mad.”</p>

<p>The two left the glade, and to their surprise found they
stood before the hollow oak which had served them as a rendezvous
when in the wood before.</p>

<p>At the foot of the oak they found Lark’s cap. As Boone
picked it up, it felt moist.</p>

<p>He looked at his hand.</p>

<p>It was stained with blood.</p>

<p>“By heaven!” he cried, in horror. “Lark has been killed,
and perhaps by the Wolf Demon!”</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI"></a>CHAPTER XLI.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE FIGHT UNTO THE DEATH.</span></h2>


<p>The two scouts looked upon the blood-stained cap with
horror.</p>

<p>“The blood is fresh, too!” cried Boone. “Lark must have
been killed by this monster immediately after we missed him
in the thicket.”</p>

<p>“It looks like it,” said Kenton, solemnly.</p>

<p>“Let us look for the body.”</p>

<p>But as they were about to commence their search, the sound
of footfalls approaching through the wood fell upon their
ears.</p>

<p>“Hush!” cried Boone, grasping Kenton by the arm as he
spoke; “do you hear that?”</p>

<p>“It’s some one coming through the wood.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and hyer all comers are enemies and not friends; let’s
to cover,” said Boone.</p>

<p>A second after the two woodmen were snugly concealed in
the bushes.</p>

<p>The steps came nearer and nearer, and then, through the
gloom of the night, the watching eyes of the two saw the fearful
form of the terrible Wolf Demon approaching.</p>

<p>He walked not now with stealthy tread but his step was
heavy and slow. His head was bent down, low upon his
breast. Slowly he came on, passed by the ambush of the
scouts, then crossed the moonlit glade and entered the thicket
on the opposite side. He was bending his steps in the direction
of the Indian village of Chillicothe.</p>

<p>Hardly had the awful form disappeared within the gloom
of the forest when Boone grasped Kenton nervously by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Kenton,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “let us not search
for the body of our friend, whom this awful thing has killed,
but revenge his death.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you, tooth and nail,” replied Kenton, firmly.</p>

<p>“Let’s follow this thing then.”</p>

<p>“Go it,” said Kenton, tersely.</p>

<p>Then the woodmen, with caution, followed in the path of
the Wolf Demon.</p>

<p>The Demon proceeded direct to the Indian village.</p>

<p>The woodmen were guided in their course by the noise of
his footsteps.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sound of the steps ceased.</p>

<p>Boone and Kenton crept forward with increased caution.</p>

<p>A few rods on and they found themselves on the edge of the
timber, and in full view of the Indian village.</p>

<p>The Wolf Demon was not to be seen!</p>

<p>The scouts then guessed the reason why the sounds of the
Wolf Demon’s tread had ceased so suddenly. The Demon
had entered the village in search of prey.</p>

<p>The path that the two had followed entered the village close
by the river’s bank.</p>

<p>It was plain to Boone that the Wolf Demon had selected the
same road into the Indian village that he, Boone, had taken in
escaping from it.</p>

<p>“We’re treed,” said Boone, as they reached the edge of the
timber and perceived that they could proceed no further in
their pursuit without danger of their being discovered by the
red-skins.</p>

<p>“A full stop hyer,” said Boone, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, it ’pears like it,” Kenton replied.</p>

<p>“S’pose we wait hyer for the varmint? Ef he went into the
village this way, it’s likely that he’ll come out the same path.”</p>

<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p>“Yes, as preachin’. I don’t know as we kin damage the
critter,” said Boone, thoughtfully. “We hain’t got no silver
bullets, and I’ve heerd say that it takes a silver bullet to stop
a spook.”</p>

<p>“We kin try,” said Kenton, decidedly.</p>

<p>“Right again, by hookey! Give us your paw, Sim; we’ll
stick by each other in this.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to death,” answered Kenton.</p>

<p>A firm grip of hands sealed the compact.</p>

<p>Then the two again concealed themselves in the bushes.</p>

<p>They watched and they waited.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the Indian village, Ke-ne-ha-ha, the great Shawnee chieftain,
sat in the gloom of his wigwam.</p>

<p>The little fire that burned in the center of the lodge cast a
baleful light over the dusky face of the warrior.</p>

<p>Dark and full of sorrow were the thoughts of the chieftain.</p>

<p>He saw again the death-scene of the Red Arrow; heard her
shriek for mercy, and then beheld the warm life-blood gushing,
free, from her young veins. Amid the smoke and flames,
she died. Like the Roman father, he had given to the death
his own flesh and blood. And that deed had brought upon
his nation the terrible scourge of the Wolf Demon.</p>

<p>Well might the brow of Ke-ne-ha-ha look dark as the thunder-cloud
when he thought of the past. And in the future he
saw no ray of light. He had little hope that the White Dog
would succeed in his mission and kill the terrible foe.</p>

<p>As he was brooding over these gloomy thoughts, his daughter,
Le-a-pah, entered the wigwam.</p>

<p>“May the White Dog speak with the chief?” the girl asked.</p>

<p>“Let the brave enter,” Ke-ne-ha-ha replied. A gleam of
light flashed over his clouded face. Why should the young
warrior seek him, save to tell of the death of the Wolf Demon?</p>

<p>A second more and the warrior stood before him. The girl
remained, discreetly, at the door of the lodge.</p>

<p>“Well?” questioned the chief.</p>

<p>“The White Dog sought the Wolf Demon in the forest,
fought him hand to hand, but the Shawnee brave fell beneath
his foot; the tomahawk was raised to strike, when Le-a-pah
bounded from the wood and the Wolf Demon held his arm
and fled from her like the night flies from the dawn.”</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha listened, in amazement.</p>

<p>“The warrior has failed,” he said, slowly.</p>

<p>“Manitou did not will that he should kill the Wolf Demon,”
replied the young brave.</p>

<p>“The brave has tried, and the Shawnee chief will keep his
word. Le-a-pah!”</p>

<p>The maiden came at his call.</p>

<p>The chief gave her to the embrace of the young warrior.</p>

<p>“You are both my children—go.” But no gleam of joy
lighted up Ke-ne-ha-ha’s stern face as he gave his daughter
into the arms of her lover. The living Wolf Demon cast a
mantle of gloom over his brain.</p>

<p>The brave and the girl withdrew from the lodge. The manner
of the chieftain forbade further words.</p>

<p>Left alone, Ke-ne-ha-ha strode up and down the narrow
confines of the wigwam in sullen thought.</p>

<p>“Oh, that my life might save my people from this terrible
scourge!” he murmured, with clenched teeth. “For the two
lives, he has taken twelve. How many more of my nation
must fall by the tomahawk of the Wolf Demon ere his taste
for Shawnee blood will be satisfied?”</p>

<p>“One!” responded a deep voice.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha turned, his blood chilled to ice with horror.</p>

<p>His eyes looked upon the terrible form of the Wolf Demon
standing in the doorway of the wigwam. In the hand of the
Demon shone the deadly tomahawk.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha gazed with staring eyes upon the terrible figure.</p>

<p>“Let the chief prepare to die. He is the last Shawnee that
will feel the edge of the tomahawk of the avenger,” cried the
deep voice.</p>

<p>With an effort, Ke-ne-ha-ha roused himself from the spell
of terror that the appearance of the dreaded Wolf Demon had
cast around him.</p>

<p>With a sudden bound, he seized his tomahawk, that had
been carelessly cast upon the floor of the wigwam.</p>

<p>The Wolf Demon made no effort to prevent the chief from
possessing himself of the weapon.</p>

<p>Tomahawk in hand, the foes faced each other.</p>

<p>Slowly they moved around the narrow circle of the wigwam,
watching each other with wary eyes, each seeking an
unguarded opening for an attack.</p>

<p>Thrice they made the circle of the lodge, the little fire, with
its glimmering light, revealing their movements to each
other.</p>

<p>Then with a spring, like unto the panther’s in quickness,
and in force, the Wolf Demon leaped upon the Shawnee
chief.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha did not seek to parry the attack, but nimbly
he evaded it by springing to one side.</p>

<p>The tomahawk of the Wolf Demon spent its force upon the
air; and as he passed, the wily Indian dealt him a terrible
stroke upon the head, that cut in deep through the wolf-skin,
and felled him heavily to the earth.</p>

<p>A hoarse note of triumph came from the lips of the chief
as he beheld the downfall of his foe. But his joy was of
short duration, for, like the ancient god of the fable that
gathered strength from being cast to earth, the Wolf Demon
rose to his feet. The shock of the fall had torn the tomahawk
from his hand, but he did not attempt to recover the weapon.</p>

<p>With naked hands—weaponless—he faced the Shawnee
chief. The blood streaming down freely over his face—over
the black and white pigments with which it was painted in
horrid fashion—made him look like an evil spirit fresh from
the fires below.</p>

<p>His eyes shot lurid flames as he glared upon the Shawnee
warrior.</p>

<p>Ke-ne-ha-ha grasped his tomahawk with desperate energy
and waited for the attack of the unarmed foe.</p>

<p>The Shawnee chieftain did not have long to wait.</p>

<p>With the spring of a tiger the Wolf Demon leaped upon
the Indian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Desperately Ke-ne-ha-ha struck at him with the tomahawk,
but the Wolf Demon warded off the blows with his arm, and
despite the efforts of the chief to prevent it, he closed in with
him.</p>

<p>Sinewy and supple was the Shawnee warrior, yet he was
but as a child in the powerful grasp of his terrible foe.</p>

<p>The Wolf Demon held him in a grip of iron. His arms,
linked round the Indian like bands of steel, were crushing the
life out of him little by little.</p>

<p>Vainly Ke-ne-ha-ha struggled to free himself from the anaconda
coil.</p>

<p>Like the serpent of far-off India, wreathing its huge length
around its prey, the Wolf Demon held the Shawnee chieftain
in his grip.</p>

<p>The breath of the Indian came thick and hard.</p>

<p>Up and down in the narrow confines of the wigwam
swayed the contending foes, like two venomous snakes coiled
together.</p>

<p>Exerting all his strength, the Indian tried to break the
grasp of the Wolf Demon. Vainly he struggled—vainly he
tried. He felt that his strength was going fast.</p>

<p>Tight and tighter grew the grip of steel.</p>

<p>The Indian turned black in the face. The blood gushed
from his mouth. He ceased to struggle. The grip relaxed
and Ke-ne-ha-ha fell to the ground, dead.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII"></a>CHAPTER XLII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE LAST OF THE DEMON.</span></h2>


<p>A look of triumph swept over the blood-stained face of
the Wolf Demon as he looked upon the lifeless form of the
Shawnee warrior.</p>

<p>From the cut in the head of the Wolf the blood was slowly
trickling, but he did not seem to mind the hurt.</p>

<p>With a hoarse cry of joy he knelt by the side of the man
whom he had strangled to death with his powerful arms.</p>

<p>He tore the hunting-shirt from the breast of the dead chieftain;
then he drew the dead man’s knife from his girdle.</p>

<p>Three rapid dashes and the Red Arrow, graven in the flesh,
was blazoned on the breast of the Shawnee warrior.</p>

<p>“Inhuman dog, more like the wolf in heart than I, thus do
I mark you,” the Wolf Demon cried in a voice hoarse with
passion. “Eleven red demons slew the Red Arrow, eleven
Shawnee warriors have I slain. Not one of the murdering
band has escaped my steel. She fell in the blazing cabin
amid the great green wood, near where the Muskingum waters
laugh and play. The assassins have fallen in the glade
and in the woodland, by the banks of the Scioto and the
Ohio, in the paths of the Shawnee village and by the lodge-fires
of the Chillicothe. I have struck them down by night
and by day. And on each breast, in memory of the Indian
maid that I once loved so well, have I stamped the Red Arrow.
Now, at last, the chief of the red band of slayers has
felt the edge of the scalping-knife. My work is done—my
mission ended, and now, death, take me for thine own.” The
Wolf Demon rose to his feet and glared wildly around him.
His eyes were starting from their sockets and gleamed like
balls of fire.</p>

<p>“What is this I see?” he cried, suddenly; “a river of
blood! It is the blood of the red warriors that have fallen
by my hand, and she the loved and lost is in its center. She
beckons me to her. I see her as plainly as I did an hour ago
when she sprung from the earth in the woodland glade by the
hollow oak, to save the young Indian warrior from my vengeance.
I know that he was not one of the assassin band
that took thy life, but in his veins ran the blood of the accursed
Shawnees, and I had doomed him to the death. But
I spared him. Did you not come from thy spirit home among
the blest and lift up thy hand to stay my arm? Go on, I’ll
follow thee! Death is near. It is welcome, for it brings me
to thee, my love. I hear the song of angels in mine ears! I
am coming.”</p>

<p>Slowly, with his eyes fixed vacantly on the air, the Wolf
Demon came from the lodge, descended the bank, and hid by
it from sight, left the Shawnee village.</p>

<p>Boone and Kenton from their ambush perceived him approach.</p>

<p>Boone touched Kenton on the arm as if to call his attention,
but Kenton had already perceived the terrible figure.</p>

<p>“Shall we fire at him?” questioned Kenton, in a whisper,
and the usually firm hand of the borderer trembled as he fumbled
with the lock of his gun.</p>

<p>“No, no!” cried Boone, quickly, and in a cautious whisper;
“the report would bring the hull of the Shawnee village
down upon as, jist like stirring up a nest of hornets.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do, then?”</p>

<p>“We’ll follow and attack him in the forest,” answered
Boone.</p>

<p>The Wolf Demon came slowly on, his eyes staring full upon
the air before him. He passed by the ambush of the two
woodmen and entered the thicket.</p>

<p>As he passed, the two noted the signs of a conflict so apparent
upon him.</p>

<p>“Jist look at his face! it’s kivered all over with blood!”
exclaimed Boone, in wonder.</p>

<p>“He’s fixed another Shawnee, I reckon,” said Kenton, seriously.</p>

<p>“Sim, it’s a terrible thing to attack this awful <a id="Ref_43"></a>critter,” said
Boone, with a grave look upon his honest face.</p>

<p>“But the death of poor Lark—”</p>

<p>“Must be avenged!” exclaimed the old hunter, compressing
his lips together, firmly.</p>

<p>“That’s so, said Kenton, with a pale face and a throbbing
heart, yet with undaunted courage.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see as he had any we’pons, but ef he’s the
devil, he don’t need any. Come on, we’ll give him a tussle,
anyway. Lord, I wish I could remember a prayer or two,”
said Boone, seriously.</p>

<p>Then with cautious steps they followed on the trail of the
Wolf Demon.</p>

<p>The singular being pursued the same path returning that
he had taken when coming through the wood.</p>

<p>He moved so slow that the two in pursuit followed him
without difficulty.</p>

<p>Every now and then he halted for a moment and then again
went on.</p>

<p>His steps became irregular. The hunters, following close
behind, noticed that he was reeling like a drunken man.</p>

<p>From side to side he swayed as he made his way through
the forest.</p>

<p>He reached the little glade by the side of which stood the
hollow oak.</p>

<p>“Let’s attack him in the glade!” cried Boone, as he and
Kenton reached the edge of the opening and beheld the Wolf
Demon standing motionless, as if irresolute, in the center
of it.</p>

<p>“Come on, then.”</p>

<p>Clubbing their rifles—they did not dare to fire for fear of
the report arousing the Indian village—the two scouts dashed
into the opening.</p>

<p>Hearing the noise of their footsteps, the Wolf Demon turned,
extended his arms as if to stay their progress, and then, with
a heavy groan, fell sideways to the ground. The sudden shock
burst the wolf-head from its fastenings to the body, and it
rolled away from the prostrate figure.</p>

<p>The scouts halted in astonishment.</p>

<p>The wolf-head gone, the head of a man, covered with light,
clustering curls, was revealed to their gaze.</p>

<p>Quickly they knelt by the side of the Wolf Demon and
wiped the blood and war-paint from his face.</p>

<p>The superstitious fear of the woodmen was all gone now,
for they knew that it was a human form that lay extended on
the earth before them.</p>

<p>The terrible Wolf Demon was dying. The tomahawk of
the Shawnee had given him his death-wound. The strong
limbs, once so powerful, were now made feeble by the near
approach of that terrible mystery that human mind never yet
has solved.</p>

<p>The two scouts lifted up the head of the dying man. His
eyes opened slowly and, with a vacant look, he gazed around
him.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a terrible dream!” he murmured, faintly.</p>

<p>The woodmen bent their heads, eagerly, to listen.</p>

<p>“It seems as if I have waded through a river of blood—fresh,
warm blood, gushing, freely, from terrible wounds. I
dreamed that I had been changed into a wolf, a beast with a
human soul, and in that soul one thought only, vengeance on
the Shawnee nation. In the light and in the darkness I
sought that vengeance. The red braves fell around my path
as the wheat falls around the reaper, yet I staid not my hand,
for the cry went up for blood, rivers of it. On each victim I
cut my mark, a Red Arrow, in remembrance of the wife that
the red demons tore from me a year ago by the Muskingum.
I was gifted with the cunning of a maniac, for at times I am
mad. The wound on my head, that I received from a falling
rafter on that fearful night when my wife was killed, affected
my brain. In my madness I must have dreamed all these terrible
things. Dreamed that I fashioned myself a wolf-skin
like a wolf, and then struck down my foes. A hollow oak in
the forest was my home; there I concealed my wolf-skin
when my mad fit was over. Oh! it was a terrible dream.”</p>

<p>Boone and Kenton exchanged glances; they knew that the
dream was a reality.</p>

<p>Then the eyes of the stricken man, glaring around him, fell
upon the strange disguise that covered his person.</p>

<p>“What is this?” he cried, in horror; “the skin of a wolf!
Then it is not a dream! No, no, I see all clearly now; the
near approach of death has cleared my eyes unto the truth.
In my madness I have been like an avenging angel to the
Shawnee nation. I see their tall forms around me now—masculine
warriors—the tomahawk cut is on their skulls, and on
their breast is graven in lines of warm blood the emblem of
vengeance, the Red Arrow!”</p>

<p>Exhausted by the outburst, his head sunk back upon the
knee of Boone.</p>

<p>“Heaven have mercy on his soul,” said the rough old Indian-fighter,
solemnly.</p>

<p>Kenton turned his head aside to brush away a tear. He had
seen many a death-scene, but none like this.</p>

<p>Again the dying man raised his head. A soft light now
gleamed in his blood-shot eyes.</p>

<p>“I see you,” and he extended his hand feebly toward the
thicket. Kenton and Boone looked in amazement, but they
beheld nothing. The sight was visible to the eyes of the
stricken man, alone.</p>

<p>“See, she beckons me to come—no more blood, but peace—peace
and love eternal. I will come—see! she is there amid
the cloud, I come—wait.”</p>

<p>With a stifled gasp his head sunk back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Boone could not repress a shudder, for he felt
that he held a corpse in his arms.</p>

<p>No more would the Wolf Demon carry terror
to the hearts of the Shawnee warriors.</p>

<p>With their hunting-knives the two scouts
scooped a shallow grave beneath the boughs of
the hollow oak, and there, by the pale light of
the dying moon, they placed the mortal remains
of Abe Lark, the terrible Wolf Demon, the
white husband of the Indian girl—Ke-ne-ha-ha’s
daughter—“The Red Arrow.”</p>

<p>The blood on Lark’s cap was easily accounted
for by the woodmen when they noticed a slight
wound on the forehead of the body, made by
some bramble in the madman’s rapid flight
through the forest.</p>

<p>Boone and Kenton returned to Point Pleasant,
and great was the wonder of all when they
learned who the Wolf Demon was.</p>

<p>The Indian expedition was abandoned. The
death of the Shawnee chieftain broke up the
proposed confederacy.</p>

<p>Winthrop and Virginia were married in due
time, much to the disgust of Clement Murdock,
who, shortly after, with Bob Tierson, emigrated
to Kentucky, and there met his death at the
hands of the Regulators for horse-stealing.
Tierson, less guilty, escaped with a sound thrashing.</p>

<p>Kate bore her cross with resignation, and
none guessed the love that was in her heart.</p>

<p>Our task is ended. The strange legend of the
Wolf Demon is ended. It is some six years
since—with fishing-rod in hand—the writer explored
the pleasant tract of country bounded by
the Scioto, the Ohio, and the Muskingum; and
he little dreamed then, when, in a rude log-hut,
an aged hunter told the strange old Indian
legend, that he should ever give to the world the
story of the Red Arrow and the Wolf Demon.</p>

the word “Dime” Novel is. Ask always for <span class="smcap">Beadle’s</span>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
